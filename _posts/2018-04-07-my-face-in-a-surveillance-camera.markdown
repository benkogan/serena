I’m posting a poem I wrote because on this week’s Cumtown the boys talked some shit on poetry. “Make it a song or make it longer and make it a story,” said Stavros. He is right that many poems would better and more accessible if they were a song or a story, but some can’t be transformed that way. This one with him in it couldn’t have been done that way. Love you Stav~~~

### My Face in a Surveillance Camera

When I looked away, I was instantly transmuted.

Pacheco’s iconography for the Immaculate Conception dictates that Mary should be standing on the moon.

Velázquez obeyed but left the orb transparent.

The fused horizon between an unpaved parking lot and night.

A blue and red light on a pole mimics an approaching police car.

A man whose living is talking waits to hear if he has cancer of the mouth.

He hosts the show I put on when I drive, drifting from my home life, work life, sex life, and what else?

Unbolt the calm and what spills out is emergency, veiled by tumbling fabrics and white smoke.

I imagine my face splashed across the landlord’s computer screen.
