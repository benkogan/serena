* _HyperNormalisation_ by Adam Curtis (2016)
{% include vimeoplayer.html id=191817381 %}
I especially recommend the sequence beginning at 01:39:38 ("America at the End of the Twentieth Century"; "dark forebodings").

From [Adam Curtis' blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/02d9ed3c-d71b-4232-ae17-67da423b5df5): "It wasnâ€™t just those in power. This strange world was built by all of us. We all went along with it because the simplicity was reassuring. And that included the left and the radicals who thought they were attacking the system. The film shows how they too retreated into this make-believe world - which is why their opposition today has no effect, and nothing ever changes..."
