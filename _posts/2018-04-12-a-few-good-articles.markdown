### [Smells Like Work: Examining Employment in Charles Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson](http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/essays/smells-like-work-labor-leisure-charles-bukowski-hunter-s-thompson/)

"Perhaps people are stagnant at work because work is stagnant. But the world is not stagnant; the world is overwhelming. Sometimes the world is beyond the reach of what our respectable employment can bring us. And sometimes it feels like the only way to conquer the world is to hunt down pleasure, rather than salary, hunt it down like our lives depend on it. It takes a charismatic kind of shamelessness, of fearlessness, to want the world without working for it. To smooth talk stupid clients into paying hefty advances for their cases, or to avoid getting beaten to death by your landlord’s stupid hit men by pointing water pistols at them. To avoid getting fired by simply being entertaining or likeable to your boss at a place that doesn’t “smell like work.” To smile strangely at your raging, threatening newspaper editor, and say, “A man never knows when he might have his head twisted.""

### [Statuary 2 from Dennis Cooper](https://denniscooperblog.com/statuary-2/)

"An emotionless Abraham Lincoln places one hand on the head of a topless woman in ecstasy and the other on the head of a naked boy. Nothing about this sculpture works. The individual parts are twee and clichéd. There’s no coherence, either spatially or conceptually. Even by the standards of 1939 each part is curiously dated–look at the woman’s hair: it looks like a style from the 1910s. The sexualised woman jars so heavily with the austere Lincoln that you can hardly compute what’s going on. Look around online, you’ll see most people’s minds immediately sink into the gutter. Which, honestly, is hardly the viewer’s fault. The work is horrible. By all accounts the sculptor, Clyde de Vernet Hunt was completely taken with his work. He exhibited a plaster version in Paris in; the figures apparently represent Faith (woman), Hope (boy) and Charity (Lincoln). Hunt brought the plaster back to the USA in 1938 and cast it in bronze for the World’s Fair. But how did three so different figures come together in one work? If we go back a decade, to 1918, we find Hunt exhibiting two works in Paris: Nirvana, a naked woman in ecstasy and Fils de France, a nude boy. At roughly the same time, he cast a statue of Lincoln. In 1928, he smooshed all three sculptures together and called it the Lincoln Trilogy." (DC)

### ["Embarrassing" from _Sham Refugia_ by Mark Francis Johnson](https://bombmagazine.org/articles/a-small-sheaf-from-sham-refugia/)

I love that so many poets have three names these days.

"...Memory <br>
  <br>
sees the river wend its clarified way <br>
town and expensive farms and on <br>
past a peachtree to marrow, as if to nothing <br>
  <br>
the marrow of nothing. Yea <br>
  <br>
loan-stars binge on my kingdom. I am old, <br>
and this dish of vanilla melts, <br>
this dear spoon I can’t remember <br>
  <br>
buying or stealing or accepting   <br>
remains a bent example <br>
of pure invention..."  <br>
