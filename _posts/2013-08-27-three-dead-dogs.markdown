Today when I do my pull-ups I watch twin deer
born in Keith and Petra’s backyard. In their first
moments they are rash-pledged, outgoing.
When I work out I watch a VHS tape of me
naked in the bath with my sister when I am eighteen
months old. Vigorously I miss the purple bath
bucket we have until I am seven. I pour water over
my sister’s head. Today instead I miss the way Petra
undresses in the morning before she takes a shower
which I also sometimes watch. I am missing the
hard white of Petra’s skin in the morning and the
hard speedy black of Keith’s car in their driveway
this I also sometimes see. I bench a hundred and
twenty three pounds in the attic and call this my
bedroom which I like to stay in and eat here
sometimes. Keith and Petra’s moms and my
backyards are all of the suburbs deep in grass and
today they are so wet.
There is a fir tree that joins ours and their
backyards together and under this twin deer are
born today. I see the new deer stand just after they
are born but I sweat into my eyes and do not see
them walk.

I am good at hearing sounds that nations make.
Today I listen to the gleaming click of the
Byzantine Empire in the rims of wine glasses.
I pretend I am homeschooled and this is my
lesson to learn about the geography of the world in
different sounds of silverware. Except I am
homeschooled and Mom does not teach me about
the sounds that I am making. I hear World War I in
restaurants I hear France and Germany ruining in
the ground. I am so deep in Byzantium I do not
make progress in my other project which is finding
all fifty states Guam and Puerto Rico. I do not get as
far West as Colorado. I do this in the evenings when
I am washing dishes I call it an extracurricular.
Meygen the Golden Retriever licks the dishes gets
soap in her mouth. This is how I find the places in
the sounds someone else makes them first. Meygen
licks the dishes then Wyoming.
I wash dishes long so I can watch Mom and
Meygen. Mom likes Meygen a lot calls her things
like sweet girl and pookie which are two names she
does not call me or my sister even though she loves
us too and best.

I can hear this too like a timeline can hear the
notes in Mom’s scream when she realizes the door
is open and the dog is dead.
What happens is Meygen our first Golden
Retriever runs into the street and gets absolutely
annihilated. It hurts Mom a lot because Meygen is
the newest baby. It is my sister’s fault because she
leaves the door open but also because she does not
like Meygen or so Mom says when they play the
blame game. My sister says Mom does not like the
dog but likes the walks at night instead. This is not
true because when Meygen dies she goes out even
though. She walks around and she comes back I do
not see her from Keith and Petra’s yard but I know
this. Mom leaves the leash on the coat rack. When
she goes out for her walks she takes it with her like
Meygen is coming back with her or else they are
going somewhere.
Mom says we will get another dog because this
is a house that needs a dog but no dog replaces
Meygen’s spirit. Mom says the only difference is
that the spirit does not sit when she says. The spirit
stays in the house chasing its tail.
