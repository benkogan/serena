I've been thinking more about my comments about Poetry Twitter in relation to [this BBC article](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180416-the-myth-of-the-online-echo-chamber), which states that fears of online echo chambers are vastly overblown and that most people are actually exposed to a variety of news sources just by being online.  When I described Poetry Twitter as an echo chamber, I short-shrifted the variety of voices. There are many, many poets and poetry projects on Twitter, and while they may share goals and values, it would be unfair to call them homogenous. 

However, I still feel that daily interaction with social media is not a healthy expectation, least of all for writers. My initial attraction to books, like most children, was escapist in nature. I was moved by the idea that writers could live odd, lonely lives and still affect strangers. That there are fewer and fewer strangers-- fewer living poets whose brains you can't livestream-- seems to me a loss. In the words of C.D. Wright, 

#### "Truthfulness is crucial. A continuous self-criticism is demanded of the effort without which only non-art gets made, that is, manufactured."

Logging on to social media to do work, whether it is searching for a journal with an upcoming contest or retweeting a friend's book promotion, seems antithetical to the very premise of writing, where language is thoughtfully considered rather than thoughtlessly dispensed. 

Which is all to say, if you like to do it, if you feel the people you interact with on Twitter are your friends, then I wish you the best in all seriousness. If, however, it feels unnatural to market yourself online as a writer, then please don't (and don't advise your students to do it). The more of us sleepers out there, the better.
