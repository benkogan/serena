Pizza hits a spot that no other food can, at least not as cheaply. Unlike a hamburger or a fast food meal, pizza is mostly plant matter and cheese, and for the lactose tolerant, pizza satisfies without weighing down. Even those who are not fond of the food itself are hard-pressed to deny the appeal of pizzerias, where everyone eats from the same pie, sliding the tray down its silver track as if at a school cafeteria.

I faced bitter disappointment in my first encounter with midwestern pizza: Chicago style deep-dish at a certain St. Louis restaurant. A pizza is not a tart, should not have fillings, and must fold, but my resentment had as much to do with paying $30 for a small pie. I was just feeling ready to try _real_ St. Louis pizza when a manager of the most famous local chain hung up a Trump / Pence sign. For a year I tried to make my own, failed mostly, and guiltily ate Dominos. When my schedule picked up again I knew I had to figure something out. 

Of the 75,000 pizzerias in America, not many are in St. Louis, so we started ordering delivery from the highest-rated joint in Southampton, a neighborhood known for its surplus of cops and Catholic parishes. Jet's Pizza offers an extensive menu of pizza varietals, including deep dish, thin, hand-tossed, St. Louis, "Bold Fold" a.k.a. New York style, 4 corner, 8 corner, something called Jet's Boats (TM), not to mention endless flavored crusts and toppings. As always, I started with medium pepperoni. What makes Jet's the best pizza in St. Louis (gulp) is the inarticulable balance of chew and crisp, richness and acidity, grease and grit. The crust isn't delicate, and the provel isn't subtle, but no element overpowers another. They'll even cut it into St. Louis style squares (rather than slices), if you ask.

But the best pizza _experience_ in St. Louis can't be enjoyed at a dining room table. I'm skeptical of any establishment that serves both pizza and beer, but Riley's Pub is the exception. Riley's is an Irish bar in the mostly-gentrified Tower Grove East neighborhood. Most of Riley's Yelp reviews are dedicated to the unsmiling bartender who _will not_ make you cocktails under most circumstances.

Riley's pizza itself is an acidic encounter which leaves the roof of your mouth stinging, if not flensed. It tastes burnt because it is burnt, or at least cooked past the point of bubbling (see photo). The crust is cardboard-thin but hard as bone, more akin to a cracker than bread. It conjurs vague cultural memories of hard tack and jukeboxes. On Mondays and Tuesdays large St. Louis style pizzas with toppings are $5 and tall boys become very cheap at happy hour. But no one is happy at Riley's; that's not the point. On the patio, groups of old guys gather to bemoan everything from protests to their wives to the recently instituted ban on indoor smoking. On a memorable August afternoon we and the bartender watched Houston flood on TV. One night I wasn't there last November, the whole bar was held up at gunpoint. Riley's pizza is neither celebration nor sustenance, but it is the perfect food to consume while marveling at the state of things. After all, if the world _really_ goes to shit, the place to be won't be SF, LA, NY, or anywhere coastal. The safest place will be inland, the unmoved prairie, where the pizza is flat, a little dry, and hurts to eat. 

Is nostalgia nostalgia if it plans to outlive you? If it has a very good shot of surviving, tucked between the old redbrick duplexes, overgrown hedges, and pocked streets?
