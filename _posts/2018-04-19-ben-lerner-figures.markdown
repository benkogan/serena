[_Mean Free Path_](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/mean-free-path-excerpt) was a little above my pay grade, but I'm very interested in these earlier sonnets. Lerner is an Aquarius :/

### from _The Lichtenberg Figures_

We must retract our offerings, burnt as they are.<br>
We must recall our lines of verse like faulty tires.<br>
We must flay the curatoriat, invest our sackcloth,<br>
<br>
and enter the Academy single file.<br>
<br>
Poetry has yet to emerge.<br>
The image is no substitute. The image is an anecdote<br>
in the mouth of a stillborn. And not reflection,<br>
with its bad infinitude, nor religion, with its eighth of mushrooms<br>
can bring orgasm to orgasm like poetry. As a policy,<br>
<br>
we are terribly sorry. But sorry doesn't cut it.<br>
We must ask you to remove your shoes, your lenses, your teeth.<br>
We must ask you to sob openly.<br>
<br>
If it is any consolation, we admire the early work of John Ashbery.<br>
If it is any consolation, you won't feel a thing.
