This weekend we visited Indiana for a memorial service.

We stopped in Terre Haute, too. I had never been to Indiana and was surprised by how poor it was. We drove by blocks of spacious suburban houses falling apart at the seams.

Bloomington is a college town, so the alcohol was good and the food was nothing to speak of. For some reason the most sloshed I get these days is when I'm hanging out with parent-types. When someone else is buying lol. I had a very refreshing gin martini at the Cardinal distillery. What I saw of Indiana University appeared much older than any college campus I'd set foot on, but I think that has more to do with the blocky medieval architecture than the actual age of the school. The memorial was held at the Bloomington Memorial Union, the on-campus hotel; we and all the cousins stayed there. At Sunday's brunch buffet in the Tudor Room I discovered the Indiana specialty of cream-cheese covered grapes rolled in pistachio. 

I was asked several times what I was planning to do with my life. My goal is to apply for jobs, starting with good jobs, moving toward the bad jobs. My hope is that the worst thing I will have to deal with will be a law office. My fear is that I won't be able to make it work. I have precious few practical skills. I think I will have to sell my car soon. I am almost entirely neglecting my schoolwork. Hopefully this Tuesday night's pool session with my three girl friends will bring me back down to earth. I keep telling myself that the trick is to write every day and god damn it I write every day. Then I want to kick all of it. I kick my work until the glowing shards break down around me. Piles of rubble are basically all I have contributed to date, and boy was I an expensive person to educate. I pray every day for the ability to think clearly but never can. My brain feels a shallow leafy swamp. 

#### Cornmeal

flecking the bottom of a pizza crust<br>
is what signifies home to her<br>
a mouthful of stucco a bite of tomato<br>

games best played with a cigarette on your lip<br>
at the black green and pink neon cowboy arcadio<br>

games you need a hot roll of quarters to play<br>
a shake of red pepper makes it even hotter<br>
when she visits home she eats many pizzas<br>

and tries to memorize eating them<br>
above their apartment a goose screams<br>
at night and then flies off somewhere
