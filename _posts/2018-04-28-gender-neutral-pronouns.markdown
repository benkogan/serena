Here's a very good [article](https://uoflwritingcenter.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/gender-neutral-pronoun-usage-in-academic-writing/) on the small but oh-so-significant issue of masculine generics:

#### "Perhaps the most blundersome use of gendered language in many students writers’ academic writing is the default to the masculine, third-person, singular pronoun _he_ and the possessive _his_. [...] This standard is most evident, and perhaps most problematic, in sentences where writers address hypothetical individuals. For example: “If a firefighter didn’t wear his protective gear, he would be risking serious injury.” In the previous sentence, the hypothetical firefighter is defaulted to being male. Though the writer avoided gender bias in the use of “firefighter” in place of “fireman,” the bias remained in the masculine pronouns."

In college I used _s/he_ in my own writing, partially because I love a slash-- check out its [extremely worthwhile Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)). But s/he pronouns are confusing and clunky and exclude anyone who goes by "they":  "Each student must submit his or her own paper." Yikes! So recently I've settled on using "they" in the [singular](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/GenderNeutralPronouns.html) and I'm glad to see that that seems to be the popular solution. 

"They" is already colloquially used in the singular, as in "Someone left their wallet on the table." "Someone" is singular and "their" is technically plural, but the sentence doesn't sound wrong (at least, not to my somewhat sensitive ear). Anyone who won't use "they" to refer to a single person on grammatical principle is full of it.  [Mistakes around the singular and plural](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/136066/either-neither-singular-or-plural) are so routine in common parlance they hardly register as errors. The written word lags slightly behind the spoken, but I predict it will catch up quickly.

I don't use Microsoft Word anymore because I'm cheap, but I remember how stringent it was about grammar back in the day. When I first started writing on a computer I relied heavily on those little explanations, but as I grew older I realized how often Word's suggestions were clumsier than what I had down, if more grammatically correct. I still get a tiny jolt of satisfaction every time I see a red line under "themself." It's not all the time you get to feel stylish and rebellious in your use of pronouns, especially if you're cis. It's gratifying to watch unmistakable political progress get made on the level of language. I'll take good omens where I can get them.
