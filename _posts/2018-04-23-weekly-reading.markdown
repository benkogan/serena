## Some Say the Lark
### Jennifer Chang

In _Some Say the Lark_ Jennifer Chang suggests that the eye (or "I") has frequently been drawn the wrong way in poetry. But how and where should the new eye look? Which traditions should twenty-first century artists embrace, resurrect, or eschew?

Though some reviewers have suggested that Chang [distrusts traditional lyric poetry](https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/awards/annual/winners/2018/award_9/), she seems to reach a fairly easy compromise with it. Expressing discomfort with the long European history of the lyric poem is not the same as troubling or rejecting it. In her words, "My ship did not wreck, nor round a graver coast. / I sailed only so far as to always see shore." She even quotes Wordsworth and Frost.

The book becomes a doomed love story. Doomed because Chang can see the flaws of the lyric so clearly and tries to conceal its weaknesses from us. Her poems are so delicately structured, each line break so carefully argued, that not much room is left for uncertainty or its cousin curiosity.

Here's an example: ["River Pilgrims"]({{"/assets/RiverPilgrims.pdf" | absolute_url}})

In this poem, the speaker walks by the shore of a river. I recognized the river immediately; it's the one near my dad's house (literally). The speaker compares herself to what she sees. She addresses an unknown character, a Sister Elizabeth (I wonder if she is addressing the township of Elizabeth, NJ?). She sees the signs of climate catastrophe in the "white tanks":

but she has been seeing those signs for years and is bored and angry with them. The loons cry. To me this is a succinct and gorgeous poem. I'm not entirely sold on her depiction of "current apocalypse" but if she riffed on the theme in other poems in the book, I would believe it. 

However, this poem is immediately followed by another portion of equal length, which begins with another question for Sister Elizabeth. I've already encountered her once and I've even Googled her. I've gone so far as to check the endnotes. I'm not getting much. I decide that I'm not supposed to know who she is and put her aside. 

The following lines refer again to climate change, a more fantastical image. Then another question which suggests something similar to "exhausted portents" ("the slightly-out-of-date grandstand"). 

Then we turn to God, capital G god (by nature of the sentence). He deletes a stump speech from a backpack (does away with pat language?). Then Chang interrupts with two lines of dialogue: "_nevermind._ I have two Bartlett pears and a Chinese umbrella. / Let's go." 

With each new line of the second stanza stanza she ties off a thread from the first and introduces something high-stakes to keep you interested. In the subsequent 4 sections of the poem she returns to addressing Sister Elizabeth and describing the waters of New Jersey, while introducing the narrative of a tragic death in the river _as well as_ a romantic narrative. 

What I sensed in this book, and something I worry about in general, is the idea that the lyric makes a certain level of ornamentation necessary. The impulse of the lyric is always to "make" thought beautiful or entertaining. If you're a beautiful thinker and a beautiful writer like C.D. Wright or an entertaining thinker and writer like Richard Brautigan you'll be just fine. But for the rest of us who mix and match, isn't better not to force thoughts into containers more beautiful or entertaining than they are?

The risk of crafting the perfect home for an imperfect spirit is emptiness, which is how I ended up feeling about "River Pilgrims." The imperfect spirit is imperfect only because it has been trapped, rather than invited. In the endnote Chang writes: "The missing body depicted and sought out in 'River Pilgrims' pays homage to the missing body of Robert Nguyen.'" By beginning the poem with the river, relating a story of romantic loss, and invoking Sister Elizabeth before even mentioning Nguyen's death, Chang ensures that the reader never sees it clearly enough to feel anything. Even in the endnote she uses the language of distance. Only because of the lyric's insistence on self and orientation towards beauty is it acceptable or necessary to treat the world at such remove, and with such decorum. 

The final couplet of the poem is:

"we love loss as we love ourselves,<br>
secretly. And too much."

By the end of the poem I've spent a lot of time at this intersection of narratives. I'm wholly convinced of the situation's beauty, the good smell of New Jersey earth, but I've learned nothing about Nguyen or how he died, or even really much about the speaker. All I know is that she experiences love and loss earnestly and sensually. I assume that of most people. 

So I do the worst possible thing for a poem ending in the first-person plural: I wonder if the conclusion really applies to me. Do we all love ourselves too much? Do I? Do we all love loss secretly? Is loving ourselves secretly (even secretively) _and_ too much exactly what the lyric mode asks of us? Is there another way?
