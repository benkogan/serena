This week I got my hands on _Privacy Policy: The Anthology of Surveillance Poetics_ edited by Andrew Ridker out from Black Ocean (can you say dream press?). I especially loved two poems from it. Here's the first. Eileen Myles thinks in line breaks that no one can imitate. 

### Notell
#### by Eileen Myles

It seems an unimaginable<br>
Forest<br>
I’m not talking to my<br>
self I’m conducting<br>
an extremely in<br>
timate exchange with my<br>
government<br>
My brash smile<br>
Means it’s okay<br>
Someone’s dancing in<br>
Clogs. It sounds<br>
That way suctiony<br>
I’m not here to con<br>
Fuse the government<br>
What I’ve<br>
Got I share. The rubied surface of<br>
Deteriorating cities moves me<br>
To this. That is<br>
what it’s doing. I call<br>
It note. Note everyone getting<br>
Off here<br>
I feel like being smart<br>
As soon as I seem stupid<br>
I top it all up<br>
