title: Why blog [about poetry]?

I was born too late to remember the days when the internet was [a community of students](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSeptember). I quickly learned that refreshing social media becomes a muscular reflex and that the only way not to check it is not to have access to the accounts to begin with. I quit Facebook first, then Twitter, then Instagram, but I had to reactivate all these accounts periodically for personal and work reasons. Living in the world today means that occasionally you will need access to social media accounts. Since I first started trying to limit my access in 2016, I've found myself on social media about once a week, every single week. My concern is less about giving companies my data and more about figuring out how to live as a social being in a world where the technology that connects us [increasingly atomizes us, too](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why). 

I have a lot of sympathy for ["targeted individuals,"](https://www.wired.com/story/mind-games-the-tortured-lives-of-targeted-individuals/) those who believe that they are being conspired against by huge powerful entities like the government or YouTube. The fact that more of us aren't clinically paranoid speaks to how normalized mass control and surveillance are. I would never advocate getting the teens off social media, but for myself I had to find a way to be on the internet without consuming a daily diet of my friends' news updates and shared posts. The straw that broke the camel's back-- the thing that got me off social media for good-- was "Poetry Twitter."

If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the hashtag [#PoetryMonth](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoetryMonth?src=hash) or the hype around [Kaveh Akbar](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=kaveh%20akbar). Social media changed the landscape of poetry: it became possible [to achieve internet fame by posting poetry](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/04/rupi-kaur-instapoets-the-sun-and-her-flowers). Internet fame is still incredibly easy to turn into real-life reward. Journals catering to young adults like Adroit, Winter Tangerine, and many others sprung up and became reputable. New spaces for poets of color were created, and slow-to-change environments like universities and established journals faced obsolescence if they did not respond. By all accounts, poetry is becoming a less segregated field, and there's no doubt in my mind that that progress is thanks to poetry Twitter. If women or trans people or any other minority is under-represented, it is more likely now than ever that the institution will be called out.

I'm happy about the progress, but I'm reserved about the side effects. My issue with "Twitter Poetry" is not that it exists but that it dominates. Like any echo chamber, it propagates sameness and discourages invention. Universities choosing Twitter-famous poets as tenure-track faculty is a funny twist to me, and I think magazines and journals of all sorts should proliferate. Anyone who wants to should be able to put their writing out there. But does it all have to have the same goals and values?

Here's a very vanilla example of how Twitter can get in the way of thinking about art if you let it. ["Poetry is, after all, the transformation of experience, not the transcription of it. --C. Phillips."](https://twitter.com/robinschaer/status/959088771802259456) This tweet caught my attention because I disagree (and because Phillips is my professor and this didn't seem like the sort of thing he would just say). I love poems that are (or attempt to be) transcriptions of experience: [the tiny trances of Lorine Niedecker](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=106&issue=5&page=27) and [the sound bytes of Brenda Iijima](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53650/skyland), for example. In the essay this quote is from, Phillips' point is _argued_. In tweet, it's an edict. My default position is to want more debate and fewer edicts in everything. 

Shortened to Twitter-appropriate soundbytes, poetry gets compressed into [inspirational quotes](https://twitter.com/carlasaludes/status/985464891820486656). This isn't a tragedy, but it doesn't make for a world I want to be a part of. Poetry Twitter isn't the way I pictured engaging with other writers and artists when I was growing up-- it's less thorough and more careerist, more about self promotion than dialogue. Call me a luddite but I'd rather read books and talk about them with IRL friends (or blog). Generally I find myself clicking "mute"-- but I hate that I have to literally "mute" people. Twitter poetry is a less aggressive sphere than most, and [the drama can be entertaining, I guess](https://twitter.com/tourniquetrview/status/941410180524314625). Because I love to be online, it was slightly sad to realize that the most easily accessible community around the thing I love was at best bland and at worst toxic. But it's futile to spend too much time contemplating these things. These days I follow the few mags I trust on Feedly, including _Fence_, _Poetry Northwest_, _BOMB_, _Blue Fifth Review_ and _The Boston Review_ and leave everything else to the kids. 

Oh yeah, and I blog. I was gifted this domain in a secret santa by someone I never really knew that well, and I've maintained it for four years knowing that eventually I would want a place to write down my thoughts. Thanks Kevin.
