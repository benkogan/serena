title: Why blog [about poetry]?

Social media has been a part of my life since Myspace, where I got my first account at age 12. For some reason I was never as addicted to it as some of my friends and family. Possibly for narcissistic reasons, I was never very interested in "stalking" old friends, crushes, or distant family members. I loved the parts of the internet where it didn't matter what you said your name was: comment sections, chatrooms, message boards. I was always more thrilled to speak to a stranger than someone I knew IRL. 

I was born too late to remember the days when the internet was [a community of students](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalSeptember). I quickly learned that refreshing social media becomes a muscular reflex and that the only way not to check it is not to have access to the accounts to begin with. I quit Facebook first, then Twitter, then Instagram, but I had to reactivate all these accounts periodically for personal and work reasons. Living in the world today means that occasionally you will need access to social media accounts: I missed countless readings and events I might have liked to attend because they were scheduled through Facebook. Since I first started trying to limit my access in 2016, I've found myself on social media about once a week, every single week. My concern is less about giving companies my data and more about figuring out how to live as a social being in a world where the technology that connects us [increasingly atomizes us, too](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/06/518362255/feeling-lonely-too-much-time-on-social-media-may-be-why). 

I have a lot of sympathy for ["targeted individuals,"](https://www.wired.com/story/mind-games-the-tortured-lives-of-targeted-individuals/) those who believe that they are being conspired against by huge powerful entities like the government or YouTube. The fact that more of us aren't clinically paranoid speaks to how normalized mass control and surveillance are. I would never advocate getting the teens off social media, but for myself I had to find a way to be on the internet without consuming a daily diet of my friends' news updates and shared posts. The straw that broke the camel's back-- the thing that got me off social media for good-- was "Poetry Twitter."

If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the hashtag [#PoetryMonth](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoetryMonth?src=hash) or the hype around [Kaveh Akbar](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=kaveh%20akbar). Social media changed the landscape of poetry: it became possible [to achieve internet fame by posting poetry](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/oct/04/rupi-kaur-instapoets-the-sun-and-her-flowers). Internet fame is still incredibly easy to turn into real-life reward. Journals catering to young adults like Adroit, Winter Tangerine, and many others sprung up and became reputable. New spaces for poets of color were created, and slow-to-change environments like universities and established journals faced obsolescence if they did not respond. By all accounts, poetry is becoming a less segregated field, and there's no doubt in my mind that that progress is thanks to poetry Twitter. If women or trans people or any other minority is under-represented, it is more likely now than ever that the institution will be called out.

I'm happy about the progress, but I'm reserved about the side effects. My issue with "Twitter Poetry" is not that it exists but that it dominates. Like any echo chamber, it propagates sameness and discourages invention. I have no problem with poets who choose to cultivate a following on Twitter; if you can do it, power to you! Universities choosing Twitter-famous poets as tenure-track faculty is a pretty funny twist to me, and I think magazines and journals of all sorts should proliferate. Anyone who wants to should be able to put their writing on the internet. But does it all have to sound the same?

Here's a very vanilla example of how Twitter can get in the way of thinking about art if you let it. Once I saw this tweet: ["Poetry is, after all, the transformation of experience, not the transcription of it. --C. Phillips."](https://twitter.com/robinschaer/status/959088771802259456) The tweet caught my attention because I disagree. I love poems that are (or attempt to be) transcriptions of experience: [the tiny trances of Lorine Niedecker](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=106&issue=5&page=27) and [the sound bytes of Brenda Iijima](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53650/skyland), for example. In the essay this quote is from, the writer's point is _argued_. In tweet, it's an edict rendered even more authoritative by the invocation of a renowned poet's name. My default position is to want more debate and fewer edicts in everything. By being shortened to soundbytes, the study of poetry (a gigantic, ancient field) gets condensed down to [inspirational quotes](https://twitter.com/carlasaludes/status/985464891820486656).

Social media is not conducive to thorough, public discussion. Generally I find myself clicking "mute" and going about my life hypercritically, distrusting even the good advice. Sometimes I find it useful to familiarize myself with whatever the current discourse is, whatever the trends are, and routinely I see orthodoxy, dogpiling, callout culture, virtue signalling, as well as some truly uninspired political takes. Twitter poetry is a less aggressive sphere than most, and [these things still occur](https://twitter.com/tourniquetrview/status/941410180524314625). Because I love to be on the internet, it was sad to realize that the most easily accessible community around the thing I love was at best bland and at worst toxic. It makes me uneasy to think of Twitter poetry's singular influence on the current moment in writing at large, but it's futile to spend too much time contemplating these things. These days I follow the few mags I trust on Feedly, including _Fence_, _Poetry Northwest_, _BOMB_, _Blue Fifth Review_ and _The Boston Review_ and leave everything else to the kids. 

Oh yeah, and I blog. I was gifted this domain in a secret santa by someone I never really knew that well, and I've maintained it for four years knowing that eventually I would want a place just to write down my thoughts. Thanks Kevin.
