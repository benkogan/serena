## The Hatred of Poetry
### Ben Lerner

From an interview at [Lithub](https://lithub.com/eileen-myles-on-loving-and-hating-poetry/):

Paul Holdengraber: I’ve reread recently Ben Lerner’s book _The Hatred of Poetry_ [...] I’m wondering if what he claims for as his Hatred of Poetry—which I think is perhaps obviously a tongue-and-cheek title—if you subscribe in some way to the way he views poetry.

Eileen Myles: I love Ben Lerner personally and I love his fictions, but I couldn’t read that book at all.

PH: That’s interesting in and of itself.

EM: He was talking about very mainstream poetry. And I felt like he was talking for people who aren’t poets, in a way. But I applaud the sentiment of hating poetry. And who better to hate it than poets? We have to hate it. We must hate it. The idea of giving poetry a month—we all know that’s kind of piss-poor.

In _The Hatred of Poetry_ Ben Lerner provides the only good explanation I have ever heard for the phenomenon of people admiring capital-p Poetry but hating all actual poems, and the related phenomenon of bad poems being truly humiliating to encounter. 

There never was a poet who could unite the individual and communal, who could truly speak for all, yet we measure all poets against that expectation. The avant-garde looks to the future for this poet; the mainstream looks to the past. "'Poetry' becomes a word for an outside that poems cannot bring about, but can make felt, albeit as an absence, albeit through embarrassment," Lerner writes. Ultimately he affirms poetry as a worthwhile enterprise, if a doomed one, even in the best of cases.

I can see how an accomplished career poet might feel she had already thought about all this book's ideas in greater depth.  That said, I'm not at all convinced by this whole "I can't read X person's books" thing. I'm even less impressed when I see that sentiment on Twitter or from young people in general. Lerner spells something important out clearly enough for a mainstream audience to understand; why should poets turn away? If anything, shouldn't we all strive for such clarity in our thoughts about poetry?

## Future Sex
### Emily Witt

These next two books were recommended to me by Ro, so if you're reading, thanks! _Future Sex_ is an almost bloglike approach to the essay form: mostly information and observation drawn from experience, but no coyness when it comes to what Witt thinks or wants. She refrains from making an argument about what "contemporary sex" is like, or what future sex will be like. Instead she traces the implications of our current sexual behavior by examining extremes: what does it mean that so many of us are open to polyamory, kinks, parties, drugs, orgasmic meditation? What does it mean that Silicon Valley workers are freezing their eggs en masse? What's up with Burning Man? 

In a way the book seems ever so slightly dated (though no less entertaining), now that hostility towards the tech industry is at a fever pitch. It seems an open question to me whether tech workers in SF are modeling the future of sexuality for the poorer, more conservative midwest. At least, when I went to the supermarket on Monday night I noticed a predominance of heterosexual couples around my age, some with young children. Then again, dads in the midwest are a large part of the Chaturbate market, so who's to say?

## Love's Executioner
### Irving Yalom

Sometimes [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21027.Love_s_Executioner_and_Other_Tales_of_Psychotherapy) just has all the answers...

Paquita Maria Sanchez rated 3/5 stars.

"Your therapist is judging you. Sorry, it sucks. I know the idea is that they are objective observers looking out for your best interest rather than the often hypercritical, dismissive average human being with a capacity for conversational boredom and bad advice, but they're not. Especially not Dr. Yalom. Dr. Yalom hates fat people, he develops a sexual attraction to one of his patients' multiple personalities and encourages her to incorporate this split-self into her overarching self so she'll be a more entertaining patient (and won't be so pathetic in general), he successfully convinces a lady to euthanize her incontinent dog in order to bolster her sex life (jerk), he sizes his patients up as hopeless human beings, rambling about how annoying certain cases were for him (with details), describing each individual while "masking their identities" to "protect confidentiality" [...] He is walking a lawsuit razor's edge, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if one of these folks showed up at his house with a pistol. There's not a chance in hell that I'd go see him after reading this. I mean, he gets pretty catty, pretty "oh shut up, you whiny little bitch." He reaaally lays into that fat lady. He calls people names. He relays very personal, very embarrassing information, and then scoffs at it. As off-putting as this is, though, it's also one of the things that make the book stick out. Honesty.

To Dr. Yalom's credit, he is not asserting that his preconceived notions about his past patients were fair or accurate. This book is as much about the individual cases he has dealt with as about his growth as a psychiatrist, his separating of his own prejudices from the therapeutic process. In that sense, it is both intriguing, and kinda weirdly narcissistic. 

This book seems less for people with a passing interest in psychotherapy, and more for future head-docs who need to really understand that in their chosen field, they are as much up against their inherent selves as they are the problems their patients are seeking help facing. The cases are mostly what I'd assume to be pretty garden variety, but they still hold interest. Well, except for that last one where it was all about analyzing some dude's dreams because, snooze. I could fall asleep listening to my loved ones' dreams, let alone those of some average stranger. It wasn't a waste of time at all, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it. Mostly because of that thing with the dog."

In all seriousness, I should have stopped reading when Yalom put a man who said "If rape were legal, I would do it" into a therapy group with _two rape victims_. My eyes were rolling out of my head when the would-be rapist on his deathbed reached for Yalom's hand and said, "Thank you. Thank you for saving my life." 

If Yalom is so honest, why are all ten cases in this book successes? What do the failures look like? He describes himself as a "last resort therapist," someone you see when nothing else has worked. He's just that diabolical, supremely comfortable deciding whose life is worth what. Sucks for the dog.
