## Homesick for Another World
### Otessa Moshfegh

_Eileen_ is one of my favorite contemporary novels. "It started out as a fuck-you joke, also Iâ€™m broke, also I want to be famous," she said of it-- all good reasons to write a novel in my opinion. Her characters are constantly picking scabs, letting wounds fester, popping pimples, noticing each other's acne, birthmarks, and swollen labia. _Homesick for Another World_ is her first collection of short stories. Out of the bunch, the stories that stayed with me were "Slumming" and "A Dark and Winding Road." Coincidentally, both tell the story of a middle-class first-person narrator using opioids with working-class strangers.

## Empty Set
### Veronica Gerber Bicecci

I couldn't find any imperfections in this book, not in metaphor, not in the sentences, not in dialogue. Not in the narrator's approach to a failed love affair. All the characters seemed like reasonable people... and I'm lucky enough to be surrounded in my real life by reasonable, well-meaning people. I come to novels wanting more (or less). In _Empty Set_ I found little mystery, despite the elevated diction. I was very interested in the use of dendrochronology at first (calculating the passage of time from tree rings) but I felt the usefulness of the theme played out long before the narrator was done thinking about it.

## Superpredator: Bill Clinton's Use and Abuse of Black America
### Nathan J. Robinson

I was in kindergarten when George W. Bush was elected, so all I know of the Clinton administration is cultural memory. I was convinced of Clinton's twofacedness by the end of the introduction, but Robinson isn't only interested in proving that Clinton signed legislation that significantly harmed African Americans. [That much is common sense by now.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank) In _Superpredator_ Robinson demonstrates beyond a shadow of doubt that the Clintons feigned interest in the well-being of blacks in America in the name of political expediency. It's a maddening book. Only a writer as good-humored, generous, and resistant to hyperbole as Robinson could make it bearable.
