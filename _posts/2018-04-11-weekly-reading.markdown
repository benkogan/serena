## Homesick for Another World
### Otessa Moshfegh

_Eileen_ is one of my favorite contemporary novels. "It started out as a fuck-you joke, also Iâ€™m broke, also I want to be famous," she said of it-- all good reasons to write a novel in my opinion. Moshfegh does body horror like no one else in the business. Her characters are constantly picking scabs, letting wounds fester, popping pimples, noticing each other's acne, birthmarks, and swollen labia. _Homesick for Another World_ is her first collection of short stories. In it she inhabits a remarkable number of first-person narrators. 

Out of the bunch, the stories that stayed with me were "Slumming" and "A Dark and Winding Road." Coincidentally, both tell the story of a middle-class first-person narrator using opioids with working-class strangers. No Moshfegh character could be said to have dignity regardless of class. Instead Moshfegh is interested in the immense variety of depravity; how it pervades all levels of society. The bizarre and the gross. Moshfegh doesn't try too hard to create an individual voice for each story; the details change, the situations change, the races and genders change, but her succinct sentence structure doesn't; the small worlds never expand beyond three or four characters. 

Towards the end of the collection she begins to push away from the versimilitude that initially attracted me to _Eileen_ and I'll admit I was slightly disappointed. An abstract, allegorical space is already achieved in the stories that take place in L.A. or around the dinner table. Why create a barely legible fantasy world at the end of the book?

## Empty Set
### Veronica Gerber Bicecci

Like Elif Batuman's _The Idiot_, I loved the first thirty pages of _Empty Set_ but found that I lost interest about halfway through. My issue wasn't the drawings, nor the charts, nor the unusual nomenclature for the characters (all the character names are stylized, i.e., (Brother(B)), (Mom(M))). These elements seemed well thought out and moreover beautiful. My problem was that I couldn't find any imperfections in this book, not in metaphor, not in the sentences, not in dialogue. Not in the narrator's approach to a failed love affair. All the characters seemed like reasonable people... and I'm lucky enough to be surrounded in my real life by reasonable, well-meaning people. I come to novels wanting more. In _Empty Set_ I found very few points of mystery, despite the elevated diction. I was very interested in the use of dendrochronology at first (calculating the passage of time from tree rings) but I felt the usefulness of the theme played out long before the narrator was done thinking about it.

## Superpredator: Bill Clinton's Use and Abuse of Black America
### Nathan J. Robinson

I will read anything Nathan J. Robinson writes. It's hard not to take pleasure in the writing of such a clear and self-determined speaker, even when the subject matter is far from fun or entertaining. I was in kindergarten when George W. Bush was elected, so all I know of the Clinton administration is cultural memory. I was convinced of Clinton's twofacedness by the end of the introduction, but Robinson isn't only interested in proving that Clinton signed legislation that significantly harmed African Americans. [That much is common sense by now.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/bill-clinton-crime-bill-hillary-black-lives-thomas-frank) In _Superpredator_ Robinson demonstrates beyond a shadow of doubt that the Clintons feigned interest in the well-being of blacks in America in the name of political expediency. It's a maddening book. Only a writer as good-humored, generous, and resistant to hyperbole as Robinson could make it bearable.
