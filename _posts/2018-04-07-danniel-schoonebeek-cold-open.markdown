Here is a poem with a tense and sexy opening tercet, followed by dazzling sprawl. A brief and utterly clear first section that leads into a more languid body is a lovely form for a poem.

### Cold Open
#### by Danniel Schoonebeek

It was the thought that —<br>
if you could watch, if I could leak to the public the film of when I needed to reach you —<br>
that would be one way.<br>

*

From a little-known bluff overgrown last summer with wildflowers,<br>
if you could watch a family of turkeys,<br>
a mother and 162 poults,<br>
if you could watch them abandon their roost on the lowest branch of a cottonwood tree,<br>
and lugging 163 tow cables behind them when they departed,<br>
if you could watch them dragging the tree through a field overgrown last summer with<br>
tanglehead grass.<br>

And discarding the yellow tree pitilessly across the rails of the Sunset Limited,<br>
which was carrying that day exactly 162 passengers west to their sentencings.<br>

It could be one way, I kept telling myself, to awake in summer when everyone’s sentenced<br>
and film myself shut of those dead to me.<br>

If the lights came up on my train in a field overgrown last summer with tanglehead.<br>
If we could slow to a halt in front of the yellow tree obstructing our path.<br>

There could be a smash cut,<br>
an establishing shot of the bluff where you knelt cutting wildflowers,<br>

and off-camera if the cottonwood started hemorrhaging yellow termites,<br>
if you could see the mites glowing yellow having drunk the yellow blood of the tree.<br>

If I could leak to you what the camera work couldn’t—<br>
in a hand-me-down suit<br>
an unsavory man<br>
he’s inside a renaissance cherry casket,<br>

and the casket’s buried eight feet beneath the Sunset Limited’s engine room,<br>
and the casket’s rigged on the inside with a hand-crank generator,<br>
with Christmas lights in five colors,<br>
if we leaked red first then blue,<br>
if we leaked green before we leaked orange,<br>
last yellow,<br>
the light of which illuminates the interior of the casket enough for the man<br>

(he’s alive)<br>

to watch his face decompose in the mirror that’s rigged to the ceiling,<br>
if we could cut to the sentence handed down to the man many years ago,<br>
that any unsavory man is a man who should watch himself die.<br>

If there was a slow zoom on a woman’s hands typing eight words in first class,<br>
a slow dissolve to a child in coach,<br>
if he fingers a text that says don’t _change for you,<br>
don’t change for me,_ if there’s no ellipsis, no period at the end,<br>
if he doesn’t need to ask who it’s from.<br>

From a little-known bluff you could stand up with a fistful of wildflowers.<br>
If you could watch the faces of 162 passengers darken unannounced<br>
as if from a lightning storm.<br>

The cottonwood could stand up from the rails and dust off her own blood herself.<br>
Resume her cold work, untangling the grasses.<br>

If you could watch my train resume its terrible campaign for the west.<br>

Unseen for you I could stay buried here,<br>
beneath 162 suitcases with the rest of the stowaways.
