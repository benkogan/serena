James Schuyler (1923-1991) was a New York School poet who became "increasingly reclusive" towards the end of his life "as he was beset with financial and health problems" (_Poetry Foundation_). His most famous poems have short lines, while his later poems have extremely long lines, and they're often colloquial. "it / isn't winter and it isn't spring / yes it is the sun" is such a lovely way of putting the weather today. 

### Spring
#### by James Schuyler

snow thick and wet, porous<br>
as foam rubber yet<br>
crystals, an early Easter sugar.<br>
Twigs<br>
aflush.<br>
A crocus<br>
startled or stunned<br>
(or so it looks: crocus<br>
thoughts are few) reclines<br>
on wet crumble<br>
a puddle of leas. It<br>
isn’t winter and it isn’t spring<br>
yes it is the sun<br>
sets where it should and<br>
the east<br>
glows<br>
rose. No<br>
willow.<br>
