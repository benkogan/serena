Clark Coolidge’s poetry was a bright spot for me in a time of immense sameness. Of all living poets, I am most indebted to Coolidge. I was twenty; I had grown out of Anne Sexton and Mark Danielewski; I didn’t know what came next. I wanted sense and I wanted what’s beyond sense. Had I encountered a more lyric poet at that time-- Ashbery, Berryman, Lowell, or Bishop-- I might have been a better student… but being a better student isn’t everything. As if to make it even more beautiful, this poem is also a sonnet.

## Gobi
### by Clark Coolidge

columnar mufflered huffs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in kelt spit back<br> 
top o the morph echo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lifters chaff chapters flue<br>
