### D/s Manifesto

1. we are your new overlords
2. we do not seek PERSONAL world domination, but IDEOLOGICAL
3. everyone with a COHESIVE ideology is a pig cop bastard, so we offer THREADS and FRAGMENTS 
4. GAIETY and FOLLY are paramount
5. PRESCRIPTIVISM is to be avoided
6. No private profiles
7. CONSIDER
8. NO WAR
