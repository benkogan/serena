[_Swedish DJ Avicii Dead at 28_](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8358389/avicii-dead-tim-bergling)

#### "And I don't want to stop typing, because I'll be left with that creepy feeling again. The exact opposite of how I felt when I heard "Wake Me Up" come out of the speakers for the very first time. It's hard to have a hit, but it's even harder to create a track you only have to hear once to get, that you've got to hear incessantly, over and over again, until it's so embedded in your brain you can play it to yourself."

When I was in high school Avicii was mainstream, a bridge between the girls that drank Bacardi and me. I remember listening to "Wake Me Up" on my iPod, on the radio, and while running laps during field hockey practice. I was still listening in 2013 when he dropped "Hey Brother," which streamed on z100 [100.3 FM] for months. 

_Hey brother! There's an endless road to rediscover_<br>
_Hey sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker_<br>
_Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you_<br>
_There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do_<br>

Avicii made dance music, not rave music. Music for the radio, not the internet, music for every high school clique (remember Claire's emo rave bracelets?). His songs precluded any less than wholesome feelings. There was nothing self-destructive about his music. His lyrics glorified drinking and partying less than many EDM DJs.  It's hard to watch people who put nothing but positivity into the world die prematurely, alone. It didn't seem like Avicii's goal to go out like a rock star. The alternative to self-medicating often isn't non-medicating but being medicated by someone else, and with less fun drugs, and even then there are no guarantees.
