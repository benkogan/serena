No, probably not.

I'm too pragmatic to advocate for the abolition of institutions, from writing workshops to universities to governments. It took me years to figure this out about myself. At the end of the day I believe many currently exisiting systems would work fine if the people making decisions made better ones. I think most problems have to do with culture, not the systems themselves. I also think that the most complex issues _can't_ be solved by [simply eliminating problematic institutions](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/complexity-and-criminal-justice). 

That said, I try to pay attention to the "burn it all down" folks, [the pessimists](https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2018/04/20/kanyes-return-to-twitter-and-liberalisms-love-affair-with-fear/#more-3871) and [the depressives](http://k-punk.org/). Their work empowers a part of me I wouldn't know how to engage with otherwise-- the part that thinks all systems are so fucked the only way forward is to rip them down and start again.

I hardly need to reiterate how repressive even the best American schools are, how they prepare students from pre-k to grad school for lives as [deferential, obedient workers](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2017/11/07/kids-these-days-review). The results are oedipal: deep-seated resentment of institutions, even hatred, mixed with attraction and need. To think critically about institutions requires access to speech outside the norm. Luckily the internet makes transgressive media readily available; you just have to know where to look. For example, from a [Dennis Cooper post](https://denniscooperblog.com/the-neo-decadents-present-drowning-in-beauty-a-neo-decadence-day/) on a group of European writers who call themselves the [Neo-Decadents](http://www.snugglybooks.co.uk/special-offers/): "Academies and workshops: a parade of inbred dogs with each generation more unfit than the last." I don't have to personally believe that statement to appreciate its usefulness in formulating my own thoughts.

By seeking out transgressive thinkers and considering what makes them transgressive, I try to keep the ground level for the battle raging inside me. In my particular case, the questions are, do I want to write what I want to write, which will be of most interest to a reader with an academic/literary background, or do I want to do work that will affect people? Do I want to teach, or do I want to stay as far away from the academy as possible? There's no way to have these conversations honestly if the only people offering  ideas are themselves academics. 

It is incredibly difficult to have equal representation of ideas from across the spectrum and only because I have a cushy stipend and lots of free time (provided by an institution) do I have the energy to think about any of this. However, if _all_ I had were the books I read for school and the academic community to discuss them with, if I didn't have the internet, rad friends, and an interest in the taboo and the untrendy, I would think that the decorous center was all there is. It's not. Someone is always on the fringe...
