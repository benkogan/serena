No, probably not.

I'm too pragmatic to advocate for the abolition of institutions, from writing workshops to universities to governments. I believe many currently exisiting systems would work fine if the people making decisions made better ones. I think most problems have to do with culture, not the systems themselves. I also think that the most complex issues _can't_ be solved by [simply eliminating problematic institutions](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/complexity-and-criminal-justice). 

That said, I try to pay attention to the "burn it all down" folks, [the pessimists](https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2018/04/20/kanyes-return-to-twitter-and-liberalisms-love-affair-with-fear/#more-3871) and [the depressives](http://k-punk.org/). Sticks in the mud. Their work empowers a part of me I wouldn't know how to engage with otherwise-- the part that thinks all systems are so fucked the only way forward is to rip them down and start again.

I hardly need to reiterate how repressive even the best American schools are, how they prepare students from pre-k to grad school for lives as [deferential, obedient workers](http://www.wbur.org/artery/2017/11/07/kids-these-days-review). The results are oedipal: deep-seated resentment of institutions, even hatred, mixed with attraction and need. To think critically about institutions requires access to speech outside the norm. 

Luckily the internet makes transgressive media readily available; you just have to know where to look. For example, from a [Dennis Cooper post](https://denniscooperblog.com/the-neo-decadents-present-drowning-in-beauty-a-neo-decadence-day/) on a group of European writers who call themselves the [Neo-Decadents](http://www.snugglybooks.co.uk/special-offers/): "Academies and workshops: a parade of inbred dogs with each generation more unfit than the last." I don't have to personally believe that statement to appreciate its usefulness in formulating my own thoughts on academia.

By seeking out transgressive thinkers and considering what makes them transgressive, I try to keep the ground level for the battle raging inside me. If _all_ I had to go on were the books I read for school and the academic community to discuss them with, if I didn't have the internet, rad friends, and an interest in the taboo and the bizzare, I might think that the decorous center was all there is. 

It's not, though. And the same is true outside academia. Anywhere there is cultural orthodoxy there are people who could look beyond it but don't. It's worthwhile to constantly seek out whatever is weird, risky, and different, and to gently but firmly prod those who don't want to believe that there is anything else to open their minds. They don't have to _do_ anything except listen.
