For a class this week I read _Two Lives: Gertrude and Alice_ by Janet Malcolm and it occured to me how many similarities there are between Gertrude Stein and Kathy Acker (1947-1997). Both women were perennially unable or unwilling to take care of themselves physically and financially; both suffered immense self-doubt and interpersonal humiliation; both relied heavily on the support of lovers, close friends (often renowned artists/writers), and admirers; both had iffy forays into AAVE. Both preferred to write in bed. Neither was especially engaged with academia, though Acker [reluctantly sought teaching work](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/cancer-became-my-whole-brain-kathy-acker-final-year) towards the end of her life. _As usual, back on the road. . . ._ According to Malcolm, even some Stein scholars haven't read Stein's "less congenial" books and the same is certainly true of Acker (are there Acker scholars? [Yeah, kind of](https://communalpresence.com/)). [Normies](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/04/after-kathy-acker-a-biography-chris-kraus-review) have accused both of favoring "style over substance"-- as if style isn't everything. Both did something with language that no one else has managed before or since.  Here are a few selections.

_My first work, written when 21 years old_

The filthy bedcover on stage I'm allergic to this way of life mine? the last time I got on stage for the first ten minutes I felt I wasn't me I was going through mechanical personality changes and actions I got scared I might flip in front of the sex-crazy lunatics finally got into the Santa Claus routine I was a little girl all excited because Santa Claus was going to bring me Christmas presents I couldn't go to sleep I was waiting and waiting and then and then you know what happened doctor Santa Claus came right into my room I'm taking my clothes my shoes off rubbing my breasts Lenny dreamt last night about fucking Cyrelle she was lecturing him on how to fuck a woman he told her that he didn't need the lecture she thought he was wrong he was sucking an older woman's cunt it was also a cock without changing from a cunt this is a romantic section a very romantic life ha ha

### from _Blood and Guts in High School_
#### by Kathy Acker

LASHES, AS IF THE WORLD, BY ITS VERY NATURE, HATES ME. Early that morning, a few hours before the sun was due to come up, nothing else in the world being due, Johnny returned home (what is home?) and told Janey he had been drinking with Sally.

It was very dark outside. She lay down on the filthy floor by his bed, but it was very uncomfortable; she hadn't slept for two nights. So she asked him if he wanted to come into her bed.

The plants in her room cast strange, beautiful shadows over the other shadows. It was a clean, dreamlike room. He fucked her in her asshole cause the infection made her cunt hurt too much to fuck there, though she didn't tell him it hurt badly there, too, cause she wanted to fuck love more than she felt pain.

### from _The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula_
#### by Kathy Acker

The beginning: 

I climb alone down the rocks of the cove. The coral reefs stretching into the sea look like mirrors of my cunt, my inner womb; then look utterly strange: black sea monsters skimming the surfaces of each other's bodies for their communication. I imagine I'm a mermaid. At night I see the sea, the ocean black against black against black, long thick lines of white appearing moving inward at my image. Because my father's chief I'm always alone and can do whatever I want. At night I run into the black ocean: a wave which I can't see lifts me up in the blackness larger unseen waves lift me breaks over my head, white, the ocean lights up! The waves grow larger I always swim alone.

I'm fifteen years old; I hate everyone. I don't hate everyone (that's stupid).

### from _Hannibal Lecter, My Father_
#### by Kathy Acker

Because he's alone, a sailor's always telling himself who he is.

### from "Matisse"
#### by Gertrude Stein

One was quite certain that for a long part of his being one being living he had been trying to be certain that he was wrong in doing what he was doing and then when he could not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing, when he had completely convinced himself that he would not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing he was really certain then that he was a great one and he certainly was a great one. Certainly every one could be certain of this thing that this one is a great one.

Some said of him, when anybody believed in him they did not then believe in any other one. Certainly some said this of him.

He certainly very clearly expressed something. Some said that he did not clearly express anything. Some were certain that he expressed something very clearly and some of such of them said that he would have been a greater one if he had not been one so clearly expressing what he was expressing. Some said he was not clearly expressing what he was expressing and some of such of them said that the greatness of struggling which was not clear expression made of him one being a completely great one.

### A Carafe, that is a Blind Glass
#### by Gertrude Stein

A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.
