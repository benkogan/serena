The last line of this poem... mmm

### Dolphin

My Dolphin, you only guide me by surprise,<br>
a captive as Racine, the man of craft,<br>
drawn through his maze of iron composition<br>
by the incomparable wandering voice of Phèdre.<br>
When I was troubled in mind, you made for my body<br>
caught in its hangman’s-knot of sinking lines,<br>
the glassy bowing and scraping of my will. . . .<br>
I have sat and listened to too many<br>
words of the collaborating muse,<br>
and plotted perhaps too freely with my life,<br>
not avoiding injury to others,<br>
not avoiding injury to myself—<br>
to ask compassion . . . this book, half fiction, <br>
an eelnet made by man for the eel fighting <br>
<br>
my eyes have seen what my hand did.<br>
