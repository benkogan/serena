I love to come across a contemporary poet I don't know, living in my city, writing gorgeous poems. I don't know anything about this person named Jennifer Fandel, but [every](http://poecology.org/issue-5/fandel/) [poem](http://baltimorereview.org/index.php/summer_2012/contributor/jennifer-fandel) I can find of hers online is striking.

### Ode to the Lovers Upstairs

Just one floor above us, they pound the joists<br>
with such intensity our windows shake<br>
and our plaster ceiling reverberates<br>
with each groan and turn and spring-loaded creak.<br>
My husband and I are startled awake <br>
to the quake that rides the earth's hard seams<br>
night after night before it shudders free.<br>
Our light fixture swings when they reach their peak.<br>
<br>
What's wrong with us, we who delight to read<br>
before bed, are just fine with once a week?<br>
Yet, since they moved in, we can't help but think<br>
of ourselves, in some position to please--<br>
sideways, upside down, under or on top.<br>
Upstairs lovers, we hope you keep it up.<br>
