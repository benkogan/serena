### First Husband

Here is a description of hundreds of years in which<br>
I never comprehend it is hundreds of years, passing<br>
“We lived together,” I write, but what does that mean<br>
Last night A. convinced me you are a parasite<br>
OK, you’re a parasite, that’s interesting<br>
My blood mixes with the blood of the flea<br>
And we’re having another poetry lesson<br>
It always takes hundreds of years<br>
You’ve interrupted us in the midst of our poetry lesson<br>
I mean “you,” the reader, have interrupted “us”<br>
By which I mean, the bad “you” and, of course, “me”<br>
Out of which construction some American relativism<br>
Comes…<br>
Meanwhile, the flea has returned to Iowa<br>
Ah, flea, let’s look into your affairs!<br>
You seem to have learned a lot from poetry<br>
I truly admired that line about how<br>
A phone charger has become entangled in a tree<br>
And your love of leopards is a neat neoclassical reference<br>
Dionysus animatedly squirting things<br>
Here I’ll insert a description of ……<br>
…………………………………….<br>
[plus provisional knowledge claim]<br>
I wish I could say, “The bad ‘you’ stomps<br>
Upon its hat,” or maybe its “hat”<br>
Or perhaps “it” “gnashes” “its” soft “teeth”<br>
But instead the bad “you” stalks me on email<br>
It sends word to remind me that it is “here”<br>
I mean, nonchalant, therefore<br>
Because this is also poetry<br>
Which is why it is part of the lesson<br>
And reinforced during office hours<br>
The sublime plum<br>
The immortal peach<br>
The slow death of the humanities<br>
Due to pluralism and (?) expense<br>
“If I can’t have them nobody can”<br>
Is what I wished he’d said<br>
Instead he asked me who the fuck<br>
I think I am in the Foxhead<br>
And the brown stick of the Iowa River<br>
We didn’t know much but we knew the river<br>
Things occurred and I can remember<br>
What my body is, in the traditional manner<br>
No politics, except in poems<br>
No deeds, except figuratively<br>
Here is a description of the pink color of heaven and in standing water<br>
Heavens have fallen<br>
I am 24<br>
Here is a thread of ice<br>
Penetrating the human sciences<br>
Once you are here, there is only living<br>
Once you were<br>
And believed I was good until you no longer believed this<br>
Of me<br>
