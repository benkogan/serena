"I'm sorry. We're sorry for the massive disruption it's caused their lives. There's no one who wants this over with more than I do. I'd like my life back."
--Tony Hayward, former CEO, BP

Everything wants to live, not<br>
even Robocop. The difference<br>
between human, employee<br>
hired hand & the ocean--<br>
simply the road gets blocked, so<br>
Carnegie built a library<br>
sixteen hours of work each<br>
shift your life is mined<br>
by one way & another<br>
bake a cake between the days,<br>
workers, dynamite, dripping<br>
things you don't want to forget<br>
<br>
headlamp, feed dog tied to post.<br>
A history of methane<br>
explodes one thousand feet<br>
in your face is a ceiling<br>
coming down? burns ninety<br>
percent of the woman's<br>
disaster porn at Big Branch<br>
coal mine, twenty-nine Do Not<br>
Resucitates, Mr. Blank<br>
Blankenship throw down a rope<br>
I've got my head but three years<br>
of citation brings the whole<br>
sputtering to today, the<br>
rules, or all Americans<br>
deserve to? The company<br>
<br>
Tina pulled levers for<br>
without meaning to,<br>
everything the Titanic<br>
pushes toward, Frued there are<br>
no accidents, whatever<br>
kept us going pegged our pants<br>
& didn't ask how does it feel<br>
to be the Terminator<br>
open fire to open<br>
like a flower on evening<br>
television? To watch<br>
bandaged heads vanish into<br>
parked here forever, soldier<br>
hold your breath you're not crying<br>
right? Good intentions come &<br>
go run up the street with some<br>
adults in need of a bath<br>
tub to slip in, piece of cake<br>
to fall out of a chair<br>
in _five, four_ is how I learn<br>
Americans have rallied<br>
round the image of the oil<br>
<br>
coated bird but browsers<br>
undirected keep opening<br>
corners of the human package:<br>
seagull, swallow the regulations<br>
the gauzy wings, eye<br>
where security guards feed<br>
dolphins full of tear gas<br>
how do you feel? Purchase<br>
the words for a season<br>
of fishing equipment under<br>
water, clean-up crews have no<br>
time to correxit. "Let's Go"<br>
Shell says, who poisoned Ogoni<br>
land with more oil than BP<br>
pipelines of dead fish, charred<br>
mangrove whisper the secret<br>
_every corporation ends_<br>
with decisive moments, then drowning<br>
like the wrong number dialed<br>
your ears fill with water then<br>
the stadium applauds<br>
decades of oil, torture, murder<br>
now the people are hacking<br>
into the pipeline<br>
don't click that window<br>
subcutaneous cellulitis<br>
aka beat hand, beat elbow,<br>
beat knee syndrome you are what<br>
they eat. Falling out teeth<br>
dreams say it, together<br>
who did nothing wrong
