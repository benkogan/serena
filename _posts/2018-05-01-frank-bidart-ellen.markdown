On the third day of being home she is as if transformed. At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached. In the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morning she is dead. “She looked as she had never looked in life—calm and happy and peaceful.”

Dearest.—I remember how<br>
at eighteen,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on hikes with friends, when  <br> 
they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,<br>
<br>
I circled<br>
around them, afraid to hike ahead alone,<br>
<br>
yet afraid to rest<br>
when I was not yet truly thin.<br>
<br>
You and, yes, my husband,—<br>
you and he<br>
<br>
have by degrees drawn me within the circle;   <br>
forced me to sit down at last on the ground.<br>
<br>
I am grateful.<br>
<br>
But something in me _refuses_ it.<br>
<br>
—How eager I have been<br>
to compromise, to kill this _refuser_,—<br>
<br>
but each compromise, each attempt   <br>
to poison an ideal<br>
which often seemed to _me_ sterile and unreal,<br>
<br>
heightens my hunger.<br>
<br>
I am crippled. I disappoint you.<br>
<br>
Will you greet with anger, or   <br>
happiness,<br>
<br>
the news which might well reach you  <br>
before this letter?<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your _Ellen_.
