### Canoodling

We were at that drowsing age of browsing for butts between the promenade’s cobblestones. Promenade was a strange word, more of a foreign theme than an American shopping center conversion therapy. When we could spare our mouths, we called it lemonade or hand grenade. It was better than being home. Each week another worker attended to our obsession with a well-smacked cigarette pack and something ludicrous. One security guard told us about a girl from his school who had insisted. A skater, all ablaze in rickety noised motion, told us that when he was our age he dumped whiskey on a business suited bum sleeping, before dropping a match, firing the whole skin sack. The same suited one watched with scorched snout as we reached into each other’s emptinesses between the magazine racks. 

Nothing happened if nobody saw. The only room we got was in the security cameras of the mall. The more people watched, the straighter we became. Eventually, we fit into the kind of life that brought us to the promenade for sure purchases paid for separately, strangers to each other, with whole families of teens waiting to defile each other into flames.
