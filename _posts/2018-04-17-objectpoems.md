On a whim I had my students do an index card activity today inspired by [Jesus Castillo](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/a-mcsweeneys-poetry-series-q-a-with-jesus-castillo-about-his-new-collection-remains). Basically you're assigned an object at random; you have to fill an index card with a poem about that object. I'll admit I cheated by writing a cornmeal poem last night, but I thought these two poems might be fun to look at.

<br>
### Coffee Mug

Drip top; cold brew; I can smell you<br>
bringing me the gift of daily habit<br>
our routine not yet static or noise<br>
because we are both there to listen.<br>
When they test the tornado sirens<br>
you rattle. The Japanese model I<br>
bought of you keeps your contents<br>
nearly scalding, the diffusion of air<br>
regulated by your innovative mouth.<br>
You burn me most mornings at ten.<br>
I watch students cross the campus<br>
each of them sucking on a nipple.<br>
You and I have a good thing going.<br>
Symbiosis: plant, woman, polymer.<br>
<br>
### Napkins

When grandmother passed she passed down plaid,<br> 
paisley, mesmerizing fish skin patterns, bright<br> 
cloth for occasions yet to be. Wine dreams<br> 
<br>
of stuffed grape leaves; a tall, misty <br>
stemmed glass; around a red lake, a ring<br>
of shrimp cocktail. The rooms of the house<br>
<br>
empty. The streets and porticos empty.<br>
In late summer the city drained of its residents<br>
and I prepared a hasty farewell dinner. <br>
<br>
I ate with the door cracked for Elijah<br>
as if spirits didnâ€™t have a standing invitation.<br>
<br>
I touched the stiff corner to the stiff corner <br>
of my mouth. A square I could fold a dove with. <br>
