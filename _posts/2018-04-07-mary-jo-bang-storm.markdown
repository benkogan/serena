Here’s the second poem I chose from _Privacy Policy_. I may post more; this anthology is very good. 

### The Storm We Call Progress

#### by Mary Jo Bang

Strum and concept, drum and bitterness, the dog<br>
of history keeps being blown into the present—<br>
her back to the future, her last supper simply becoming<br>
the bowels’ dissolving memory in a heap before her.<br>
A child pats her back and drones _there-there_<br>
while under her lifted skirt is a perfect today<br>
where a cult of ghost-lovers predicts a rapture<br>
but instead remains to inherit varicose veins,<br>
rubber knickers, douches with bulbs, douches with bags,<br>
girdles in a choice of pink, red, or white,<br>
and in rubber, silk or twilled linen, enemas, clysters, oils,<br>
balms, and other Benjamin etceteras burrowing<br>
like scabies into the brain’s ear as it listens to the click<br>
of the next second coming to an end.<br>

Throughout,<br>
the senseless waste of reaching up to pull down<br>
a machine-made device from the rafters, a beatific<br>
mythical magical deity. Sturm und drang, storm<br>
and stress, turbulence and urge, turmoil and ferment.<br>
A revolution goes right, then wrong. The right falls<br>
in love with an icon. They force the landscape into a box.<br>
They lock the box with the key inside. The aristocracy<br>
is an improbable agent of change. Whispering<br>
is no longer saying out loud, the all-seeing god a brother<br>
grown bigger by another name.<br>
_Adv._ sadly<br>
He stared sadly at the ruins of his house. _traurig_<br>
Er starrte traurig auf die Ruinen seines Hauses. _sadly_<br>
