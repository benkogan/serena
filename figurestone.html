		<h1>Figure Stone</h1>
	<i>After Sally Mann's "The Ditch"</i>
<br>
<br>
During the bad months I kept a fishbowl<br> 
&emsp; of black rocks on the coffeetable<br>
<br>
Home to an ailing moss <br>
&emsp; sheared by aquarium's filter<br>
<br>
Moving to dust, I cracked open<br>
&emsp; along a faultline in the glass<br>
<br>
No one noticed sand darkening<br>
&emsp; as there was already so much water<br> 
<br>
The grays--faceted as fly's eye--<br>
&emsp; washed out green & dried violet<br>
<br>
Dyeing the towel of an onlooker, her mouth's twist<br> 
&emsp; the first evidence of concern<br>
<br>
Dead, the moss turned to wet brick<br>
&emsp; The boy, a crab in the waves,<br>
<br>
So silent I came into the room,<br>
&emsp; turned on all the lights before seeing<br>
