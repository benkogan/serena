		<h1>Figure Stone</h1>
		<p2>
<br>During the bad months I kept a fishbowl
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of black rocks on the coffeetable
<br>
<br>Home to an ailing moss 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheared by aquarium’s filter
<br>
<br>Moving to dust, I cracked open
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along a faultline in the glass
<br>
<br>No one noticed the sand darkening
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as there was already so much water
<br>
<br>The photo’s grays— faceted as fly’s eye— 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;washed out green and dried violet
<br>
<br>Dyeing the towel of an onlooker
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her mouth’s concerned twist
<br>
<br>Dead, the moss turned to wet brick
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man a crab in the waves
<br>
<br>So silent I turned on all the lights
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before seeing him sitting 
<br>
<br>Still in our living room, sapped 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first of color, then of sound
<br>
