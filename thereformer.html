		<h1>The Reformer</h1>
		<p2>
<br>
You hurried us past the scrum around a white sheet 
<br>on the sidewalk. The next time we didn’t stop to gawk 
<br>at the dredged cove. I know it’s bitter of me to think
<br>
<br>of these deaths when I address you but as you said
<br><i>you’ve just got to get rid of stuff, it's so liberating. </i>
<br>When you wouldn't come to the march I moved alone 
<br>
<br>through a long knot of living people, then returned 
<br>to the house to help clean before the sale. Help me 
<br>stop connecting these times you wouldn’t look 
<br>
<br>into a narrative I can make use of. Help me act 
<br>more like marble— marmoreal, the word is, 
<br>which has in it milk animals and death.
<br>
<br>=
<br>
<br>In my bag I carry your kimono— radically
<br>appropriated— so it might get worn,
<br>
<br>so years of dust might get punched out of it
<br>by my radically inappropriate form.
<br>

<br>
<br>Around us goodbyes are being said, drawn-out hugs 
<br>and crying jags. Goodbyes with several acts. Your eyes pace 
<br>my outline until you pull goggles over them, then a mask 
<br>
<br>against the stale air that would breach mouth and nose.
<br>I refuse to think it is only a scarf that obscures your face.
<br>I consider emulating your stride through the sliding doors
<br>
<br>or trying to, jogging to keep up as you buzz through
<br>the loose groups of farewellers out to the concourse
<br>straight-backed as every day after we left for school
<br>
<br>when you strapped your wrists and ankles to weights
<br>and let the machine do the lengthening. 
<br>I don’t know where you— my mother— live.
