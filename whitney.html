		<h1>Whitney</h1>
		<br>
		
		When did this expression eat each of your other expressions<br>
		such that eyes wide with care set broad & wilder<br>
		<br>
		Before you I assumed intricacy & style but I was mistaken<br>
		you know by heart schematics I expected to push you over<br>
		<br>
		like froth on stone Whitney the use of first name<br>
		mining an interlude face mightn't reflect<br>
		<br>
		I was glad to have heard you can outmaneuver fear<br>
		with a workbook of scenes ranked hierarchically by stress<br>
		<br>
		Safety is not confidentiality or grace or a question<br>
		for a woman I won't speak to again Whitney<br>
		<br>
		I begged you to say this speculum this gristle<br>
		& pinching bordered with heat might like lead<br>
		<br>
		be recalled beneath the paper this body might be<br>
		outside the myth your body tells you Whitney<br>
		<br>
		that as a woman you might understand women<br>
		when they speak or that each little incapacity<br>
		<br>
		might be one and the same Whitney my spectrum<br>
		of exposure my reminder of sanctuary eating lunch<br>
		<br>
		at your desk Whitney the myth I know by heart what hurts<br>
		is not the opening but the gaze Whitney you do good<br>
		<br>
		& amusing work your face splayed open so proudly<br>
		it could camouflage the disarray of power in your hands<br>
