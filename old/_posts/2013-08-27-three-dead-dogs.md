    Today when I do my pull-ups I watch twin deer
born in Keith and Petra’s backyard. In their first
moments they are rash-pledged, outgoing.
    When I work out I watch a VHS tape of me
naked in the bath with my sister when I am eighteen
months old. Vigorously I miss the purple bath buck-
et we have until I am seven. I pour water over my
sister’s head. Today instead I miss the way Petra
undresses in the morning before she takes a shower
which I also sometimes watch. I am missing the
hard white of Petra’s skin in the morning and the
hard speedy black of Keith’s car in their driveway
this I also sometimes see. I bench a hundred and
twenty three pounds in the attic and call this my 
bedroom which I like to stay in and eat here some-
times. Keith and Petra’s moms and my backyards
are all of the suburbs deep in grass and today they
are so wet.
    There is a fir tree that joins ours and their back-
yards together and under this twin deer are born to-
day. I see the new deer stand just after they are born
but I sweat into my eyes and do not see them walk. 

2
    I am good at hearing sounds that nations make.
Today I listen to the gleaming click of the Byzan-
tine Empire in the rims of wine glasses.
    I pretend I am homeschooled and this is my les-
son to learn about the geography of the world in dif-
ferent sounds of silverware. Except I am home-
schooled and Mom does not teach me about the
sounds that I am making. I hear World War I in
restaurants I hear France and Germany ruining in
the ground. I am so deep in Byzantium I do not
make progress in my other project which is finding
all fifty states Guam and Puerto Rico. I do not get as
far West as Colorado. I do this in the evenings when
I am washing dishes I call it an extracurricular.
Meygen the Golden Retriever licks the dishes gets
soap in her mouth. This is how I find the places in
the sounds someone else makes them first. Meygen
licks the dishes then Wyoming.
    I wash dishes long so I can watch Mom and
Meygen. Mom likes Meygen a lot calls her things
like sweet girl and pookie which are two names she
does not call me or my sister even though she
loves us too and best.  

3
    I can hear this too like a timeline can hear the
notes in Mom’s scream when she realizes the door
is open and the dog is dead.
    What happens is Meygen our first Golden Re-
triever runs into the street and gets absolutely annihi-
lated. It hurts Mom a lot because Meygen is the
newest baby. It is my sister’s fault because she
leaves the door open but also because she does not
like Meygen or so Mom says when they play the
blame game. My sister says Mom does not like the
dog but likes the walks at night instead. This is not
true because when Meygen dies she goes out even
though. She walks around and she comes back I do
not see her from Keith and Petra’s yard but I know
this. Mom leaves the leash on the coat rack. When
she goes out for her walks she takes it with her like
Meygen is coming back with her or else they are
going somewhere. 
    Mom says we will get another dog because this
is a house that needs a dog but no dog replaces
Meygen’s spirit. Mom says the only difference is
that the spirit does not sit when she says. The spirit
stays in the house chasing its tail.

    When my girl and I are children she calls me a 
creep feeder but this alters a lot. Now she takes a 
pill every day for me.
My girl a little looks like the girl whose photo is 
on the math textbook my sister is using this year 
and a little like my sister if I think about it too 
much. My girl does not care that I do not go to 
school. In fact I do not know if she goes to school. 
We meet when we are new ones but we live on the 
same street just behind different houses. Her father 
has one arm but I do not meet him. He loses the arm 
she says as if it wanders like Meygen down the road 
in a farmtruck accident. It is not convenient she says 
this I believe. She says she loves me when we are in 
the fourth grade and I build off this forever. She is 
mine like the noun like the explosive thing going 
off inside me a phrase I read not create but she 
smiles to it. 
    It is the damp months when it is nice to be out-
side. I cannot remember what dry things are al-
though they are everywhere. My girl tells my mom 
I say this. Mom takes me to an oldfound doctor in a 
new office.

5
    I am not in trouble for thinking there are no dry 
things but for saying it. The doctor cannot prescribe 
this which I tell Mom in the car.
    In fact I am right the doctor’s prescription has 
nothing to do with the textures I cannot unfeel for 
example the yardmorning sun like my girl’s cheek 
against my face if I have just shaved.  I tell the doc-
tor that this is a very overdiligent way of putting it.
 His problem is that I do not know how to read 
which is a problem even for someone in my condi-
tion. He says he knows I know about a lot of things 
including the word vespertilionine because I’m 
good at rooting a term he comes up with to describe 
when people find things under the surface of the 
world. He says trustman and I believe him. He 
threatens nothing to me but Mom is silent all the 
way home except to say that it is hard for her to pre-
tend that I know things I do not know. 
    To fill up the space I try to make her know. I tell 
her but she does not listen. I explain to her that 
when I look at paper I think someone is slitting the 
skin between my fingers trying to deny that I am 
amphibious, creek-wading, green.

    American Idol premieres this year for the first 
time. It is a good thing because Mom treats Idol like 
it is semilegendary. 
Mom knows I cannot read for a long time but 
teaches me masonry instead. It could be not mason-
ry but she says she is carving stone my sister laughs 
over me. Mom gives me books with pictures and 
engineering but does not listen to me when I tell her 
it is not words that bother me but the paper. Then of 
course I eat the paper not when we are in the 
kitchen but when I am in my room thank God she 
buys paperback. It rains again everything wet again 
but smooth like salmon skin when Mom takes the 
pan off the stove. My girl throws away two pill cas-
es but the twin deer who are born in the spring do 
not return. We have a new dog who is a good good 
dog. He sleeps in my bed when Mom makes my girl 
go home.
    My girl says her father with one arm calls thun-
der and lightning the War of Northern Oppression. 
When Ulysses S. Grant dies they drape the build-
ings of New York in black fabric. My girl is buried 
in his tomb is a joke she likes.

    Sometimes my girl and I don’t have sex for a 
week because at the end of the week I find her 
pussy is so tight. 
    When we finally do it she tells me she loves me 
fivefold and bites my shoulders which makes me 
feel tight too. I don’t tell her I love her though at 
least not with my voice although I buy boxes of 
strawberries and pastoralized milk for this girl. I 
love her like I love Goldenrod who is our new 
Golden Retriever. Goldenrod likes to eat paper out 
of the garbage can which is excellently convenient 
for me. My girl and Goldenrod familiarize around 
me and it is nice. I learn many things from them too 
but the biggest is that she and Goldenrod whisper to 
each other and laugh together I do not know what 
she says but afterwards she puts her head on my 
chest and I like it. I love them I love them I know I l
ove them and my sister and my mom and Petra.
    What my girl and Petra have in common is that 
their tits in fact their whole body parties are heaven-
built. When nobody is home and my girl and me 
with Goldenrod are upstairs together we all scream 
pent-up lazy things.

8
    My girl finds Goldenrod at the bottom of the 
stairs. He runs into the wall across from the bottom 
of the stairs he breaks his neck is what happens. 
    He is just a puppy I love all baby things. He is 
just a puppy and happy until what happens is not a 
surprise. There is not a lot of blood but he is 
snapped. I keep his leash although it is the same one 
Mom takes with her at night looking for Meygen 
our first dog. My doctor says it is bad luck not my 
fault which my mom thinks and says to him and 
thinks I do not hear. Actually Meygen is my sister’s 
fault I do not say and nobody’s fault the second time 
if a puppy falls he falls. I can feel the paper folding 
inside me again. My mom is angry even though she 
does not love Goldenrod the way I do. My girl takes 
it hard cradles him to her. When I cry she says 
Goldenrod is like our child but that one day soon-
day there is no pill. 
    When Goldenrod dies I am inside my girl and 
the walls of her feel hot and red. In this place I can’t 
hear anything except her ankles slimming against 
my ass and her voice in my ear saying I’m yours 
baby I’m yours.

    Crumble the new dog does not like the deer. 
There is a war to see who is older. The Golden 
breeder gives him to us half off. 
    This is the doctor’s decision for us to keep the 
dog. Mom does not like him because he has a bad 
temperament. My sister says the doctor is full of 
shit for making us but she is dating an Aryan whose 
heavyhandedness is getting thick. Everything he 
says she worships. For one thing he says is that the 
breeder obviously only has bad dogs which is not 
true. He says there is something wrong with Crum-
ble because he snarls too much. I snarl too much. I 
pass them asleep when spring grows old. The Aryan 
is curled around my sister sleeping so much on top 
of her. My girl is in my arms sometimes but I wake 
up a lot with her behind me her legs around my legs 
her tits against my back and then we both sleep 
well. 
    The doctor has a lot to say about my girl. He 
says she is a good girl. My girl knows how to read 
and knows about paper although she does not see 
me eat it. She says no matter what I am brilliant. 
When she cries I know how to turn off the faucet.

    When it happens it all happens very slow. Mom 
and Petra start to know pink things about my girl I 
know this through the open window.
My mom gives me no more books. She shows 
me letters on the television. Mom says I should not 
mow lawns for people anymore. I am good at pre-
tending to know how to read but not good at pre-
tending Crumble does not like me. Sometimes at 
night he bites me hard but I do not let anybody 
know. My girl fixes my body and says some planti-
ng has happened to hers. She says we need to inter-
comprehend each other. I try to make her hear New 
York in the fragile opening of the window but 
Crumble barks too loud. He never bites me in front 
of her or anyone. I make my decision solo and I am 
as careful as I know how. I cannot hear the music of 
places and history when he is barking it is like 
killing a tree to read. I kill him before no one. 
    I do it very quietly or try to. I take off his collar 
first because it is Goldenrod’s. Crumble does not 
hold still for me he bites. I forcep his head and 
twist. He does not die but shatters. I am curious to 
hear the sound. Second time he goes eyes closed. 

11
    Mom says I am an evil child. I do not know why 
my mother says this. I am capable of moral under-
standing says the doctor about me.
    I am grounded I have nowhere to go it is a tech-
nicality. Late Crumble’s end night my girl sneaks in 
when Mom is asleep for something important. She 
sees me sitting empty on my bed and she puts her 
arms around me and I feel that they are thin. She 
puts her head on my shoulder. She says hey hey hey. 
Her concern snaps my throat. She says she knows 
Crumble is a bad dog. She knows Crumble attacks 
me first all the time. She says there is something 
else. She wraps her legs around my waist but I am 
upright. She has lots of hair my girl lots of it weep-
ing on my chest. I do not talk to her for a long time 
but I do not want her to go. I can see the shadows of 
the dogs on my wall in the dark but I know they do 
not stand so tall. 
    I do not want to have bed dreams alone so I 
make her stay but quiet. I toss a bottle of water on 
myself do not wake up. All wet I come towards her 
all wet she accepts me we do not fuck. The Aryan 
leaves his yellow hair in the sink.

12
    My girl tells me to hangtough and builds these 
domesticities for me in which she wears an apron 
and has dinner on the table every night. 
    In school at the kitchen table I am learning 
about giving credit where credit is due which I do 
not understand before today right now. The doctor 
says I learn from tapes which I already know be-
cause upstairs I have a VHS tape in which I am 
naked in the bath with my sister when I am eighteen 
months old. Vigorously I miss the purple bath buck-
et we have until I am seven. I love the hard white of 
Petra’s skin in the morning I see Keith kiss it some-
times. They help each other. I like concepts I can 
touch but I have trouble finding them. My girl helps 
me. She does her work near me but only on the 
computer. She jokes I will eat her math homework 
and coughchuckles. I am not grounded Mom will 
not look at me. 
    Mom makes chickpeas with oil. She says to my 
sister that I do not know how to think but all the 
time I think about the crinkles in her lips and how if 
I could I would kiss them and tell her the only evil 
thing about me is that I am not gold.

    In wintertime my girl bends over in front of me 
but does not laugh. My sister bends behind herself 
to warm her hands on the radiator. 
    I think my sister and the Aryan will marry soon. 
The Aryan feels the way about my sister the way I 
feel about my girl which is that I love her and I wish 
there were enough fluid inside me to cover her and 
fruit-preserve her body. My girl is at home with her 
one armed father who says he needs her help with 
firewood. I call her my lumberjack imagine her 
sexy in the frost. My girl’s daddy has an electric 
fireplace but he is very lonely. My sister opens her 
wallet to my girl around Christmas and my girl 
shakes her head. She is very modest I know that it is 
for a Christmas present for me. My mother gets a 
lot of books with pictures of women on the front out 
of the basement but leaves every time I come into 
the room and takes them with her. 
    I fall asleep with my head on the kitchen table 
listening to a man speak Japanese very slowly. My 
mother thinks I should learn a language that is easy 
for me because I am good at sounds. I do not under-
stand everything I learn to speak less. 

14
    Last Christmas my girl makes me a sweater all 
on her own. Last Christmas Meygen comes in a box 
and my sister cries for the last time. 
    The holidays are very hard there is a lot of pa-
per. My presents do not come wrapped but this year 
they do not come at all. My girl is radio silence two 
weeks. I wonder what happens to her father’s arm in 
the farmtruck. The Aryan goes to his family for the 
holidays and my sister goes with him. Mom talks 
about the unbaptized tries to teach me about Con-
stantinople. What is a silly empire besides the rat-
tling of a teaset. My girl comes over but does not 
take off her shirt. She makes no noise at all. I ask 
her when is the last time she moans for me and she 
does not answer. My mother gives away a lot of lit-
tle flyaways like the upstairs television and gems 
but keeps Meygen’s leash. Christmas Day is a day 
foundering in still no one talks to me. 
    I bench two hundred pounds just before the New 
Year. I have a lot of time. My sister who has no time 
tries to choose a college too far away. Mom cries 
says nothing. My sister says the Aryan is taking her 
away I do not doubt him. 

15
    One deer picks through the snow in the yard be-
hind our house. There is nothing to eat I do not give 
it an apple.
    Covered in dogblood I can’t wash off I watch 
the deer and miss my girl’s laugh and moan and the 
sounds of her getting up to piss at night. Behind the 
house three dogs lie. I go out into the backyard for 
the first time since the snow comes down it is Pe-
tra’s skin spread out whiteplains of it down the road. 
No graves mark no one knows of Crumble but my 
girl and my mom and my sister and my doctor and 
me. The snow is dry and soft and skinlike and I lie 
down and I hope my girl can see me. It is almost 
dark the deer sees me and does not move. My girl I 
swallow her and inside of me she opens up. I hear 
two deer born I hear three dogs die I hear the click-
ing of the light hear Petra naked above me in her 
bedroom. 
    She looks at me smiles and I look at her my 
whole self sweating. She presses her silhouette on 
the window. I raise my hand to wave the deer runs 
off. Petra stays where her curves are for a moment 
then raises her hand and closes the blind.
