## The Philosopher-King

He called his grand scheme sophiarchism and it was ludicrous. As he prepared the oils, butters, silver instruments, and paint, he outlined a system of government where the only voters were holders of social science PhDs. The notion that the governing power should be concentrated in the hands of capable specialists. Heavy stuff. She wasn’t entirely sure she had the right take but something seemed... unpatriotic about it. He approached her with an emory board and lazily she shifted her hand so that it lay on the armrest of the reclining chair. He began to file her pinkie gently. That he had a grand scheme was lovely, she thought. That he had a scheme at all. His polo was mint green, his apron pure white, his khaki pants straight to his strong-looking legs. He worked cocoa butter into her skin. When he hit the spot between her index and thumb bones, tense as a broken wing with carpal tunnel, she moaned. “Oh,” he said softly, as if surprised, “Lisa, let it go.” When the manicure was over he brought her a thimble of espresso, jet black in a doll-size cup.
