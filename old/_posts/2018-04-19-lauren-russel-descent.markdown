I keep the [poems-a-day](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem-day) that I like in my inbox. Here's one.

### from _Descent_

_Bob:_

Can I be your lazy eye, your wander-<br>
lust, your grave without a headstone,<br>
your bleeding gums, your buck teeth<br>
and your walk bowlegged at the knee? Can<br>
I be your fortune hunter, your glimpse<br>
of wild geese, your red russet shoes<br>
that poison the feet? Reckon this is the best<br>
of my seed. Been stripping cane and blind<br>
robbing the bees. Reckon youâ€™ve thought<br>
of swimming the creek. Last night they came<br>
on horseback, white hoods like phantoms<br>
scanning the trees, burning torches, shattering<br>
sleep. I dragged the shotgun from the door<br>
and stepped squinting onto the porch.
