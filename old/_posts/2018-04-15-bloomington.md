This weekend we visited Indiana for a memorial service.

We stopped in Terre Haute, too. I had never been to Indiana and was surprised by how poor it was. We drove by blocks of spacious suburban houses falling apart at the seams.

Bloomington is a college town, so the alcohol was good and the food was nothing to speak of. The most sloshed I get these days is when I'm hanging out with parent-types.

The memorial was held at the Bloomington Memorial Union, the on-campus hotel; we and all the cousins stayed there. At Sunday's brunch buffet in the Tudor Room I discovered the [Indiana specialty](https://delightfulemade.com/2015/12/04/cheese-grape-pistachio-truffles/) of cream-cheese covered grapes rolled in pistachio, called "truffles." 

#### Cornmeal

flecking the bottom of a pizza crust<br>
is what signifies home to her<br>
a mouthful of stucco a bite of tomato<br>

games best played with a cigarette on your lip<br>
at the black green and pink neon cowboy arcadio<br>

games you need a hot roll of quarters to play<br>
a shake of red pepper makes it even hotter<br>
when she visits home she eats many pizzas<br>

and tries to memorize eating them<br>
above their apartment a goose screams<br>
at night and then flies off somewhere
