Dear Liz I do
not know if you
can hear thisThings are
different now
for I know I will
never move this
arm againDo you
remember what
it feels like to be
among rows of
new potatoes?I was
remembering
you when I left
alone this
morningRemembering
when we
thought we
would stay here
in the countryOn the side of a
road with not
enough soil I
went down with
the tractor I feel 
Weight like all
the weight in the
world I now
know there is
nothing but this 
Do you
remember when
Dalia was four
we went to the
Grand CanyonOut west was so
much sun so
bright there
seemed like
none at allI keep seeing
you with my
eyes closed you
looked so
beautiful yourHiking boots red
from sand your
lips all dry for
you gave Dalia
all your waterShe drank it
even though her
body was so
little you put her
on your backShe fell asleep
with her mouth
open and her
drool mixed
with your sweat 
Darkened the
back of your
shirt you were
so beautiful you
two my girls
The Grand
Canyon is so
much bigger
without you I
will come home
Soon to look at
you my darling
my ring is gone
in the dirt with
the palm
And each one of
my fingers
underneath the
tractor your
fatherâ€™s ring
I am so sorry I
did not carry
Dalia on my
back and for
drinking all my
Water even
though I knew
you were thirsty
I will give you
all my waterDear Liz I do
not know if you
can hear me but
