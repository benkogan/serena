## Death of a Naturalist

All year the flax-dam festered in the heart<br>
Of the townland; green and heavy headed<br>
Flax had rotted there, weighted down by huge sods.<br>
Daily it sweltered in the punishing sun.<br>
Bubbles gargled delicately, bluebottles<br>
Wove a strong gauze of sound around the smell.<br>
There were dragon-flies, spotted butterflies,<br>
But best of all was the warm thick slobber<br>
Of frogspawn that grew like clotted water<br>
In the shade of the banks. Here, every spring,<br>
I would fill jampotfuls of the jellied<br>
Specks to range on window-sills at home,<br>
On shelves at school, and wait and watch until<br>
The fattening dots burst into nimble-<br>
Swimming tadpoles. Miss Walls would tell us how<br>
The daddy frog was called a bullfrog,<br>
And how he croaked, and how the mammy frog<br>
Laid hundreds of little eggs and this was<br>
Frogspawn. You could tell the weather by frogs too<br>
For they were yellow in the sun and brown<br>
In rain.<br>
<br>
             Then one hot day when fields were rank<br>
With cowdung in the grass, the angry frogs<br>
Invaded the flax-dam; I ducked through hedges<br>
To a coarse croaking that I had not heard<br>
Before. The air was thick with a bass chorus. <br>
Right down the dam, gross-bellied frogs were cocked<br>
On sods; their loose necks pulsed like sails. Some hopped:<br>
The slap and plop were obscene threats. Some sat<br>
Poisoned like mud grenades, their blunt heads farting.<br>
I sickened, turned, and ran. The great slime kings<br>
Were gathered there for vengeance, and I knew<br>
That if I dipped my hand the spawn would clutch it.<br>
