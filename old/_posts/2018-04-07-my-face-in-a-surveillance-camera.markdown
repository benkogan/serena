I’m posting a poem I wrote because on this week’s [Cumtown](http://shoutengine.com/CumTown/ep-96-dan-schneider-goes-down-55336) (at 18 minutes) the boys talked some shit on poetry. “Make it a song or make it longer and make it a story,” said Stavros. He is right that many poems would better and more accessible if they were a song or a story, but some don't make sense that way. This poem with him in it couldn’t have been done that way. Love you Stav. Glad you aren't dying of cancer~~

### My Face in a Surveillance Camera

When I looked away, I was instantly transmuted.

Pacheco’s iconography for the Immaculate Conception dictates that Mary should be standing on the moon.

Velázquez obeyed but left the orb transparent.

The fused horizon between an unpaved parking lot and night.

A blue and red light on a pole mimics an approaching police car.

A man whose living is talking waits to hear if he has cancer of the mouth.

He hosts the show I put on when I drive, drifting from my home life, work life, sex life, and what else?

Unbolt the calm and what spills out is emergency, veiled by tumbling fabrics and white smoke.

I imagine my face splashed across the landlord’s computer screen.

“Our Lady should be painted as a beautiful young girl, 12 or 13 years old, in the flower of her youth. She should be painted wearing a white tunic and a blue mantle. She is surrounded by the sun, an oval sun of white and ochre, which sweetly blends into the sky. Rays of light emanate from her head, around which is a ring of twelve stars. An imperial crown adorns her head, without, however, hiding the stars. Under her feet is the moon.” –Francisco Pacheco, _The Art of Painting_ (1649)
