		<h1>Shorts with Inner Brief</h1>
		<p2>I.<br>
		Shortly after moving west I grew breasts unlike<br> 
&emsp;the modest assumptions I sported in college.<br>
Questions of form became questions of function.<br>
&emsp;Are these straps load-bearing. Will a dog<br>
evade the leash. How many inches between cup<br>
&emsp;& bust’s width. Does a tree make its own shade<br>
or does the storm fill seedbeds with darkness<br>
&emsp;when it passes. Can I run in it. I started running<br>
when I arrived, then the bra incident. Or did the tits<br>
&emsp;come first. Or the linty bits of pollen clogging<br>
the pond. Or the ruins admiring their ample<br>
&emsp;reflection. Did I bring the damn things with me<br>
or were they already here, splayed by the ramp<br>
&emsp;as if thrown from a car. How did I attach<br>
this extra flesh to my chest. Where it sits was once<br>
&emsp;an air conditioned room. Now isn’t heavy exactly<br>
but the heat. To evade it I consult the oak<br>
&emsp;who shivers above and beneath the ground.<br>

			Shade is the leg of a pig. <br>
			&emsp;Like us, ants will <br>
			come a long way to eat<br>
			&emsp;and to bring back.<br>
