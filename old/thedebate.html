		<h1>The Debate</h1>
		<p2>
<br>To me the candidates look like horses led
<br>into a ring but behind me someone points out
<br>the man’s resemblance to a wolf, the way 
<br>
<br>his neck retracts into his ruff and his teeth 
<br>get naked, graze her flank, leave welts like
<br>red ornaments. I trace a fence with the crowd.
<br>
<br>Smoke billows from a distant lot— exhaust, 
<br>probably, but I draw closer to the nice jackets
<br>ahead, scanning the jumbotron for her magnified
<br>
<br>visage as balloons flood the stage. On the screen
<br>she stands encircled by buttons, themselves
<br>embellished with rhinestones. They applaud.
<br>
<br>Decked with rubies, a flag congratulates her
<br>open-armed on the evening. When it’s done
<br>everyone gets to go home with a tote bag
<br>
<br>except for her. In my notes I put down 
<br>four words I’m only starting to understand
<br>the meaning of: <i>horses don’t get gambling.</i>
