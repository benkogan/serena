		<h1>Poem from which I removed the pants he made— 
<br>a pair of trousers patterned with grapes— and filled
<br>the space where they were with my own images</h1>
		<p2>
<br>
An island in the shape of a soft-edged star, a parade 
<br>of women wearing only hard hats, some muddy sneakers— 
<br>which of these is the answer? He would turn me by 
<br>
<br>my shoulders until I saw whatever hemmed or studded 
<br>thing. Then I’d zip myself into it. A lake, a runway, a pair
<br>of banged-up feet— I click through and arrive at the top again.
<br>
<br>Once, in September, we passed through concentric orbits. 
<br>He wore a decadent necklace. I didn’t like to see him sew
<br>his label into the linings. I wanted both sides of the fabric 
<br>
<br>bare, for him to leave unsigned his linen sculptures. 
<br>His mind was not his hands, which were not the stitches, 
<br>but the distance was shrinking. So was the range of what 
<br>
<br>we could talk about. A foggy park, a prickly pop star, 
<br>a night so dark I feared there might be bears. I learned 
<br>something from watching, from being measured:
<br>
<br>that my gaze is too a knife, as cold and sharp
<br>as anyone's. The problem was not the label
<br>but the maldistribution of threads that connected us
<br>
<br>bunched up as they are at the beginning. We canoed,
<br>I waited for a long time to see him, we walked together
<br>from a dark wood house. When we spoke we both spoke.
