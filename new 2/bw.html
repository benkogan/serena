		<h1>Lithosphere</h1>
		Maybe the problem is scale. I can't manufacture age<br>
		or enormity; they aren't in me. I can read, but barely.<br>
		Modes of expression crawl over each other like ants<br>
		in the ground, each one bearing poison to the colony,<br>
		resolute as the knowledge of pain before it reaches home.<br>
		I rely on aesthetics so imprecise they are rendered best<br>
		in earth: this ripple of mountains, dark sleeves of road,<br>
		cross-sections of sediment and weather, lights crowding<br>
		any temporary city. Or, in opposite, the earth that parts<br>
		to swallow a woman, a cow, the gap shorthand for the fear<br>
		that grips. Reverence for beauty is itself abhorrent;<br>
		these are instincts familiar in equal parts. Yes,<br>
		we can synthesize. Truthfully, I am compelled to.<br>
		But we aren't earth. We don't know what we make.<br>
		<br>
		<h1>Accretion</h1>
		Manipulation of substance: glory, suspension,<br>
stasis,the satisfaction of arrangement rippling<br>
through the body. Stillness: marble cut into blunt<br>
steppes, dull with grit, anchored by cable bolts.<br>
No life but sound in the quarry, a thrumming whine,<br>
mechanical shovels bleating dust as they burrow.<br>
Wheels shed pebbles in waves; water pools bright<br>
and shallow; wind thrills through newly-formed pits<br>
unassuming in all but magnitude. Beneath, though,<br>
movement hot and frantic: insistent substitution,<br>
modifiers overflowing, potentials swarming insensate,<br>
the enormity of reason in language throwing shadows<br>
on its ecstatic utter lack.<br>
