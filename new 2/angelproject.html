		<h1>Shorts with Inner Brief</h1>
		<p2>I.<br>
		Shortly after arriving in St. Louis I grew breasts unlike<br> 
	the modest assumptions I sported in college.<br>
Questions of form became questions of function.<br>
	Are these straps load-bearing. Will a dog<br>
evade the leash. How many inches between cup<br>
	& bust’s width. Does a tree make its own shade<br>
or does the storm fill seedbeds with darkness<br>
	when it passes. Can I run in it. I started running<br>
when I arrived, then the bra incident. Or did the tits<br>
	come first. Or the linty bits of pollen<br>
clogging the pond. Or the ruins admiring their ample<br>
	reflection. Did I bring the damn things with me<br>
or were they already here, splayed by the ramp<br>
	as if thrown from a car. How did I attach<br>
this extra flesh to my chest. Where it sits was once<br>
	an air conditioned room. Now isn’t heavy exactly<br>
but the heat. To evade it I consult the oak<br>
	who shivers above and beneath the ground.<br>
