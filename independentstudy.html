		<h1>Independent Study</h1>
		<p2>
			<br>We’re studying stones when I find what you’re seeking. 
<br>I hold the shovel between your spurts of digging. You say 
<br>to survive the tissue must have been buried all at once. 
<br>Don’t bother with the paperwork. Any bone might ruffle 
<br>the sand, but we have precious little of the soft stuff. 
<br>
<br>You fill the bucket I hold with red clay, once and maybe
<br>still alive. I sift for a trace of insects, proof of movement 
<br>in the Great Already, but you’re carving stairs in the pit. 
<br>Now a desk. Soon a room where you’ll bring me.
<br>
<br>This is the problem with digging for digging’s sake,
<br>with a kiss on the hand of a much younger woman. 
<br>Unless rock solidifies around bacteria they will live 
<br>for dinner parties, any chance run-ins with the flesh. 
<br>
<br>I am lucky to be burdened with all this equipment, 
<br>lucky it fits in one hard-shell case. The last you see 
<br>of me is the skeleton of a whale strapped to a minivan. 
<br>I drive away with everything useful. I leave your 
<br>blacklight behind for the next.
