		<h1>Daniel</h1>
		<br>
		<p1>That last time, emerging from the ice hell<br>
			of your office, I ducked beneath your window<br>
			& ran six blocks to the train. I did not breathe<br>
			until the 1 pulled from the station. Even home<br>
			my skin crawled with your eyes' wide sympathy.<br>
			<br>
			The five weeks I visited you last winter I spent<br>
			wishing violence came easier (I had not felt<br>
			this way about a man before you). Across<br>
			the river from your office on 81st Street<br>
			the Hess tank farm marks where I grew up.<br>
			<br>
			A park complex fitted between the landfill<br>
			& the low-slung sky. Through your small<br>
			ground-floor window I strained to see as far.<br>
			You didn't turn your empty face from me.<br>
			Grass-tails up to my shoulders breathe<br>
			<br>
			without rustle. Listen. We were introduced--<br>
			referred--by a friend of mine, patient of yours,<br>
			who claims alternately to love & need you.<br>
			She says you have a cast of ridiculous hats<br>
			to cover that you're balding but only once,<br>
			<br>
			thankfully, do you wear one (a plaid pageboy).<br>
			Past your shoulder I gazed at characters in a script<br>
			I fought myself to read. Instead of hanging,<br>
			you propped the frames against the wall.<br>
			I took issue but <i>you know a lot about Asian art,</i><br>
			<br>
			you promise. I want to find them soothing<br>
			but my body knows--remembers--flat lines,<br>
			these strokes of wind bearing across the Pacific<br>
			art & letters, my mother & uncle. Your office d√©cor.<br>
			How to trust a person who invades open space<br>
			<br>
			with own image, coats the room in treatment's<br>
			steel language. Your voice's latex gloves.<br>
			We never talk about gutstring fear or memories<br>
			of scale--my fault for being childish & reticent. (I drag<br>
			my bike into the weeds. I'm fifteen by the stable,<br>
			<br>
			the compound's only fences. Stoned, my friends<br>
			entertain a horse but I can't move any closer.<br>
			Air sharpens to blade around me.) Even so I take<br>
			every scrip you write with blind child's hunger.<br>
			At all costs ($250/hr) you refuse to ask questions.<br>
			<br>
			<i>Say more.</i> I swore to labor under no man's direction.<br>
			I tell you I'm considering a firearms license,<br>
			assuming we're on the same side of this politically...<br>
			When I start to hear knocking all the time in silence<br>
			I read laws, permits, other matters of public record.<br>
			<br>
			Strangest is I lose interest in television (the love<br>
			of conversation thrumming out of earshot). Off,<br>
			the screen glowed thin with early morning fire.<br>
			I slept enviably, gained weight. One session we sat<br>
			the whole time in silence; the next day you called<br>
			<br>
			to expel me from the pageant. Our friend tells me<br>
			it happens; you, you, can just decide it's too messy.<br>
			Two regrettable emails. <i>I thought you'd say that,</i><br>
			you sigh. I've always had a taste for this kind of luxury,<br>
			how you heft & worry power. Over & over<br>
			<br>
			you claim--like prayer--that we barely know<br>
			each other. It's enough. In college you lived<br>
			in my building, just upstairs. You know I write;<br>
			I know you're married. Against your better judgment<br>
			you see both me & my boyfriend, who is worse off,<br>
			<br>
			for a while. You tell us what we say about the other,<br>
			affirming that you can be manipulated. I'm ashamed<br>
			of this weakness on all our parts. Of misjudging<br>
			how much you could bear. Have you watched the clouds<br>
			of an overgrown model airfield? Have you noticed<br>
			<br>
			the bloodied paper towels in your bathroom garbage<br>
			each Monday? I wonder if I'm the first to bring<br>
			a large knife for you & small for me to this office<br>
			--I doubt it--doubt I'm alone in my fear of you.<br>
			When I refused to let you stop you called my mother.<br>
			<br>
			Had you asked me once you might have known<br>
			she isn't my guardian. That was the last time<br>
			I let you bathe me in that sorry, self-righteous smile,<br>
			that conqueror's expression. As you suggested,<br>
			she flew in, wept, asked me if it was her fault.<br>
			<br>
			We went to a Thai place not far from your office.<br>
			She lied to me, though I already knew what you<br>
			had done. Walking back after I realized this pain<br>
			is in the name of a narrative I peel fully cast<br>
			from the mold. Though there were still unpleasant<br>
			<br>
			hours left, the winter regained its dignity, I mine,<br>
			or what was left of it. Then it was all over--<br>
			you held no more of my interest, save this.<br>
			You show up late, 25 minutes past grace,<br>
			halfway through our appointment, & your hands,<br>
			<br>
			your determined briefcase, hold nothing.<br>
			Nor does the park. The board of trustees<br>
			tries to charge a local theater group $10,000<br>
			to rent a clearing that did not exist in my youth<br>
			--cleared at least. I recall biking only twice,<br>
			<br>
			both times in a year that Facebook existed<br>
			& looked much the same as it does now. You,<br>
			more interested in recent developments, can't<br>
			be blamed--you might argue reason's tepid<br>
			remove. I have portrayed myself in bald light.<br>
			<br>
			I did not expect you to do the same. Knowing<br>
			(as I do for sure) you are a steadfast & responsible<br>
			person, I am assured you will go on unchanged.<br>
			Likely I will pass by you on the Upper West Side<br>
			years from now & oil will have spilled from tank<br>
			<br>
			to river. It is no secret that this brief trial will not<br>
			chastise you. I know it to be justice nonetheless.<br>
