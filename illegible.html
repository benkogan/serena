		<h1>The Illegible Heirloom</h1>
		<p2>
When the journal arrives after the funeral,<br>
perfumed with incense as if itself alight,<br>
I am told what it says. I cannot distinguish<br>
shaking earth from burnished bridge from<br><br>
a concise life bound backward. Its characters<br>
evade me. The alcove, the screen, the outcrop,<br>
each refuses my efforts to parse and combine,<br>
each entry a shadow behind thick washi panels.<br><br>
What I receive is mine, even if it passes the way<br>
a father might demolish his house to build<br>
two smaller houses. It’s enough to see how<br>
a thing is passed on. I don’t need to ask<br><br>
what it’s good for. What anything<br>
given dutifully could be good for.<br>
