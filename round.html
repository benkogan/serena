		<h1>Round</h1>
		<p2>
			<br>
			This is a poem for two people<br>
			on either strip of soil.  You, me,<br>
			<br>
			ease irrelevant. The benign form of morning,<br>
			the white underparts of your arm<br>
			<br>
			seeking warmth. I sat in your chair<br>
			for a long time today. All the paintings<br>
			<br>
			at the Cloisters and the only one I want<br>
			to look at: the impression of a lion<br>
			<br>
			restored to stone. This is for a cactus<br>
			swelling hopefully with water. You,<br>
			<br>
			the impression, warmth in soil. Morning,<br>
			you, the one I want, seeking ease,<br>
			<br>
			swelling with water. I sat for a long time,<br>
			you, me, irrelevant. This, for two:<br>
			<br>
			the Cloisters, the cactus. The underparts<br>
			stripped hopefully to form. I look<br>
			<br>
			at your arm; water over me. Stone<br>
			seeking soil. Today the impression<br>
			<br>
			of my form with your form, shadows<br>
			swelling white, voices outside the window,<br>
			<br>
			you easy for a long time. This is a poem<br>
			to a cactus seeking warmth, painting<br>
			<br>
			stone to soil. For two people sitting in water.
